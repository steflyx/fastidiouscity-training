              " 'Milwaukee (CNN) Only one of the three men shot during a night of protests in Kenosha last month survived, and he\\'s still reliving it every day.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all I think about,\" Gaige Grosskreutz, 22, told CNN in an exclusive interview Tuesday. \"I play it back in my head, I think about it all the time.\"\\n\\nThe gunshots, the screams and the chaos that followed still play out in his head as if it were August 25 again.\\n\\n\"I think about everything all the time,\" Grosskreutz said.\\n\\nThat night, protesters in the Wisconsin city were demanding justice after an officer repeatedly shot Jacob Blake in his back while his children watched from his car.\\n\\nKyle Rittenhouse, 17, is accused in the shooting during the protest that followed. He had an affinity for police his social media makes clear. He took part in a program for youth interested in becoming police officers.\\n\\nNow he faces two felony charges of homicide in the deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony M. Huber, and a felony attempted homicide charge in Grosskreutz\\'s incident. Rittenhouse is also facing charges of possessing a dangerous weapon while under the age of 18, which is a misdemeanor. Under Wisconsin law he is not legally allowed to possess a gun at his age. His attorney says he acted in self-defense.\\n\\nAs Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, fought for his life at the hospital after being shot by an officer on August 23, protesters took to the streets.\\n\\nPolice and civilians faced off the first night and the second. But on the third night, August 25, demonstrators and visibly armed civilians also faced off.\\n\\nBefore the shooting, Rittenhouse -- clutching a long rifle -- told a journalist who was trailing him that he was a trained medic, according to a criminal complaint. The teenager worked part time at a YMCA before being furloughed due to Covid-19.\\n\\nGrosskreutz said he worked as a paramedic before going back to college in Wisconsin where currently he is studying. Grosskreutz said he has attended many peaceful protests in Milwaukee -- which has seen more than 100 days of protests -- against police brutality and racial injustice.\\n\\nBut the night he encountered Rittenhouse changed his life, Grosskreutz said.\\n\\n\"I was shot point blank with a .223 round from the shooter,\" Grosskreutz said. \"And I am now missing 90% of my bicep. This has not been easy emotionally, physically. I\\'m in constant pain, like excruciating pain that just doesn\\'t go away -- both in my arm, in my heart.\"\\n\\nAccording to the complaint, Rittenhouse shot the first victim, Joseph Rosenbaum, multiple times after the victim threw a plastic bag at him and tried to grab Rittenhouse\\'s gun. Rittenhouse then ran away and was chased as people appeared to try to stop him, video shows. He then fired off more rounds, killing Huber and badly injuring Grosskreutz, the complaint says\\n\\nAs police and emergency vehicles raced to the scene and videos of the fatal encounter appeared on social media, the armed suspect walked past a group of officers with his arms raised and the rifle hanging from his chest. He turned himself in to police the next day, 30 miles away in Antioch, Illinois.\\n\\nGrosskreutz says he packed his medic bag -- and his licensed gun\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Social media reveals more about Kenosha shooting suspect Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Social media reveals more about Kenosha shooting suspect 02:46\\n\\nDisturbed by video of the Blake shooting, Grosskreutz said he made the 40-mile trip from his home in Milwaukee to Kenosha to attend the protests.\\n\\nGrosskreutz said he packed medical supplies in a small backpack to be ready to provide medical attention. He also said he decided to bring his licensed gun with him. He said he was concerned after seeing a call to arms on Facebook by a group called the Kenosha Guard, a self-styled militia group that was using the social media platform to encourage armed citizens to take to the streets.\\n\\n\"Everybody was there exercising their right to protest. And there were some people who were exercising their right to bear arms, including myself,\" he said.\\n\\nGrosskreutz said he saw a need for medical assistance that night and put on a paramedic hat and stepped back from protesting to treat those who were injured -- on either side of the protest.\\n\\n\"He was down there to try to provide assistance to everybody indiscriminately,\" said Grosskreutz\\' lawyer, Kimberley Motley.\\n\\nSocial media video captured the shooting as it unfolded\\n\\nSocial media video from live streamers that night captured events as they unfolded.\\n\\nRittenhouse is seen taking part in shootings at two locations. In one video, the criminal complaint against him said, Rosenbaum threw a plastic bag at him and tried to disarm him and Rittenhouse fatally shot the man.\\n\\nIn two other videos, Rittenhouse was seen running and people yelling and chasing after him. Someone yelled, \"He just shot someone.\"\\n\\nAnd someone else replied, \"Get his a**.\"\\n\\nRittenhouse appears to trip and falls to the ground. He fires his weapon as one man gets close but misses, video shows.\\n\\nThen Anthony Huber uses his skateboard and hits Rittenhouse in the shoulder and then falls on him.\\n\\nAccording to a criminal complaint, Huber appeared to reach for the suspect\\'s gun with his hand while holding the skateboard in the other. As Huber tried to grab the gun, the suspect pointed it at his body and fired one round, video shows and the complaint reiterates\\n\\nHuber was seen staggering away and then falling to the ground. He died from his gunshot wound, according to the complaint.\\n\\nGrosskreutz then is seen approaching Rittenhouse and is shot in the arm at close range.\\n\\nGrosskreutz can be seen running away. He has a large wound and his arm is not moving. You can also see a gun in the hand of his injured arm. He can be heard screaming for a medic.\\n\\n\"I never fired my gun,\" Grosskreutz said. \"I was there to help people. Not hurt people.\"\\n\\nGrosskreutz said he has had run-ins with police in his past and paid his debt. But he says he had every right to carry his firearm.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not a felon,\" he said. \"I have my concealed carry, I\\'ve had it for years. That was my gun. My firearm. I had a legal right to possess it and to possess it concealed.\"\\n\\nMotley, Grosskreutz\\' attorney, said Rittenhouse did not have a right to have his weapon. He is charged with possessing a dangerous weapon under the age of 18.\\n\\nIn a statement to NBC News , Rittenhouse\\'s attorney John Pierce said, \"This was classic self-defense and we are going to prove it. We will obtain justice for Kyle no matter how hard the fight or how long it takes.\"\\n\\nGrosskreutz said he never used his gun that night, even after being shot.\\n\\nThe last patient he tended to was himself, Grosskreutz says\\n\\nGrosskreutz said he did not expect that the last patient he would treat that night would be himself.\\n\\nGrosskreutz said he used his own medic bag and with the help of CJ Halliburton, who was streaming the entire incident live but stopped to help Grosskreutz, he was able to have a tourniquet applied to his arm before police drove him to the hospital.\\n\\n\"That was a grievous wound. Had I not had my training and proper equipment ... to treat a gunshot wound, I might not be here doing this interview,\" Grosskreutz said\\n\\nHe described a chaotic scene over the course of that night before the gunfire. Buildings had been damaged and fires had been set by people taking part in the protests.\\n\\nHe said police used tear gas and rubber bullets.\\n\\nBefore the shooting took place, video shows police being friendly with Rittenhouse and handing him water.\\n\\n\"And then they gave the shooter water at some point in time and said that they appreciated the shooter,\" he said of police, referring to a video from the scene before the shooting occurred.\\n\\nMotley said there was blame to go around for Rittenhouse\\'s actions, including law enforcement who didn\\'t stop him from leaving; Facebook for not taking down posts of the Kenosha Guard event; the person who gave Rittenhouse the gun; and anyone who helped Rittenhouse cross state lines after he shot several people.\\n\\n\"Although (Rittenhouse) may have been the one who pulled the trigger, there certainly are a lot of people that put bullets in that gun,\" Motley said.\\n\\nFacebook later apologized for missing the Kenosha Guard post. A Facebook spokesperson told CNN the page violated the company\\'s policy on militia organizations\\n\\nWhen asked why officers did not stop Rittenhouse from leaving the scene, Kenosha Sheriff David Beth told reporters that tunnel vision can occur in high-stress environments like that August 25 night.\\n\\nGrosskreutz said he and his family, including his 65-year-old grandmother, are getting death threats online from people who support Rittenhouse.\\n\\n\"None of it is true, of what people have been saying as far as their assumptions toward me, at least,\" he said. \"I\\'m not an Antifa terrorist organizer. I am a 22-year-old male. I go to school. And yeah, I exercise my First Amendment right to peacefully protest.\"\\n\\nGrosskreutz is still being treated by doctors in the same hospital where Jacob Blake is being treated for his gunshot wounds.\\n\\nRittenhouse is in jail in Illinois. He has an extradition hearing on September 25 to send him back to Wisconsin where the charges were brought against him.\\n\\n\"The shooter walked away and got to sleep in their bed that night. Some people didn\\'t get that luxury -- two people that night, myself (as well), didn\\'t get that luxury,\" Grosskreutz said.\\n\\nGrosskreutz stared at the floor, tears in his eyes.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going through a tough day but like I said, I\\'m a strong person,\" he said. \"But everybody\\'s hurting from this in one way or another. I walked away with my life that night but two people didn\\'t.\"',\n",

              " '(CNN) Albert Broussard\\'s intention to capitalize one letter in one word may impact millions of children around the US and how they learn about race.\\n\\nWhether to capitalize the b in Black is also part of an ongoing historical debate on racial identification that dates back to sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois more than a century ago.\\n\\nMcGraw Hill is one of the country\\'s largest K-12 textbook publishers that may use Black capitalized following protests over the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed May 25 after a White police officer was seen on video pressing his knee onto his neck.\\n\\nThe ultimate decision on whether a capitalized Black will be used in Broussard\\'s revision will be made by McGraw Hill\\'s internal staff editors, authors and academic advisers, which is a diverse group of people, the company told CNN over email. The publisher is \"strongly considering it,\" McGraw Hill said.\\n\\nAlbert Broussard in his home in Texas. He is one of the most prolific textbook writers in the US.\\n\\n\"I just personally would like to see it capitalized because I think African American and Black are used interchangeably by most people in the population,\" Broussard said. \"If you start children out thinking about Black or White or any group that way, that\\'s how they will think about them for the rest of their lives.\"\\n\\nMcGraw Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are purveyors of the final drafts of history. While it is unclear how many textbooks each company sells each year, more than $209 million worth of K-12 social studies books were sold in the US in 2018, according to data provided to CNN by the Association of American Publishers.\\n\\nThe Associated Press and New York Times were among numerous publishers of the first drafts of history to capitalize Black recently. CNN made the same decision and will also capitalize White.\\n\\nCengage, an education and technology company which has nearly a dozen different K-12 history programs and books in the US, will capitalize Black and White while Houghton Mifflin Harcourt will be capitalizing Black.\\n\\n\"Cengage has undertaken a review of our textbooks and learning platforms for both higher ed and K-12 to evaluate our standards and practices. The capitalization of \\'Black\\' and \\'White\\' has been raised for consideration as part of this review, and is being adopted in texts where pertinent to the discussion, including the most recent edition of AP Human Geography,\" the company told CNN in a statement.\\n\\nThese decisions have been praised by teachers and education experts alike.\\n\\nThe educational habits children develop can make a difference\\n\\nA shift from using black to Black in K-12 textbooks is a step in the right direction, said Michael Hines , an assistant professor at Stanford University\\'s Graduate School of Education.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a recognition of the significance of the fact that Black people throughout the African diaspora share commonalities of history, culture and identity,\" Hines told CNN over email.\\n\\nThis was a sentiment shared by Gerardo Muñoz , a social studies teacher who has taught in Denver Public Schools for 21 years. He is a producer and co-host of the podcast \" Too Dope Teachers and a Mic \" which addresses race and education in the US.\\n\\n\"It is very important, in my opinion, to use Black instead of black. In a very subtle way, black minimizes the importance of being Black. Because Black Americans were ruthlessly and abruptly cut off from their own national and ethnic identities, they don\\'t have the privilege of attaching a homeland, spiritual or otherwise, to their American identity,\" Muñoz told CNN over email.\\n\\nMany educators and experts agreed that the use of a capitalized Black in textbooks only works if teachers explain its importance. These sorts of classroom conversations can have a lasting impact on young impressionable minds, said Shawn Matson, a high school history teacher in Madison, Wisconsin.\\n\\nNkemka Anyiwo , a developmental psychologist and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, has studied how messages youth receive about race affect their development. These messages, also known as \"racial socialization,\" play a significant role in how young people understand themselves, she told CNN through email.\\n\\nSchools build the foundation of young people\\'s knowledge and play a crucial role in the racial and sociopolitical socialization of young people, Anyiwo said.\\n\\nWhile the longtime use of lowercase black in textbooks may seem minor, \"it can operate as an implicit form of racial messaging that perpetuate Black inferiority,\" she added.\\n\\n\"We have to ensure that teachers have the competency to clearly explain the importance of and impetus behind the language transition,\" Anyiwo said. \"Young people may not understand the significance of the transition without explicit conversations with teachers about the historical and political significance of \\'Black\\' as identity and America\\'s historical legacy of using \\'black\\' as a tool to disenfranchise.\"\\n\\nThis is not the first time Black people have wanted a letter capitalized\\n\\nDu Bois and Edward A. Johnson, the late teacher who was also the first Black member of the New York legislature, fought to change how descendants from Africa were written about and identified.\\n\\nEducator William E. B. DuBois testifying on the UNCIO (United Nations Conference on International Organization) charter during hearings by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\\n\\nDu Bois campaigned vigorously for the capitalization of the word Negro roughly a century ago when it was the accepted term at that time, said Hines, the Stanford professor.\\n\\nIn 1910, the US Census included an item called \"color or race\" for the first time. The instructions permitted people to use \"Mu\" for mulatto and \"Ot\" for other and \"B\" was called \"black,\" Pew Research Center reported . The word black \"included \"all persons who are evidently full blooded negroes.\"\\n\\nDu Bois, one of the founders of the NAACP , started a letter-writing campaign in the 1920s calling on publications such as The New York Times to capitalize the letter N in Negro.\\n\\n\"I regard the use of a small letter for the name of 12 million Americans and 200 million human beings, as a personal insult,\" Du Bois wrote in the 1920s, according to the book \" How to Be Good with Words .\"\\n\\nThe Times turned Du Bois down in 1926 and eventually relented in 1930. The newspaper called the change \"not merely a typographical change\" but \"an act in recognition of racial self-respect,\" The Times wrote earlier this month when it decided to capitalize Black.\\n\\nRoughly 40 years before the Times changed its stance on Negro, Johnson published \"A School History of the Negro Race in America from 1619 to 1890.\"\\n\\nThe book offers \"sketches of slavery as it existed in the colonies — northern and southern\" and describes the \"accomplishments of some of the most distinguished slaves,\" the University of North Carolina wrote in a summary of the book.\\n\\nJohnson\\'s book was published in 1890. It implored teachers to adopt the use of Negro with a capitalized N.\\n\\n\"I respectfully request that my fellow-teachers will see to it that the word Negro is written with a capital N,\" Johnson wrote . \"It deserves to be so enlarged, and will help, perhaps, to magnify the race it stands for in the minds of those who see it.\"\\n\\nAttorney Edward Austin Johnson\\n\\nDiscussions around racial identification and the use of Negro continued well into the mid-1900s.\\n\\nThe word Negro remained on the Census in the 1960s during the heart of the civil rights movement. The word was commonly used by civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. For example, in a speech he gave in 1960, King said, \"The shape of the world today does not permit America the luxury of exploiting the Negro and other minority groups. The price that America must pay for the continued oppression of the Negro is the price of its own destruction.\"\\n\\n\"Black\" did not reappear on the Census form until 1970, Pew said.\\n\\nIn 1971, the Congressional Black Caucus was formed. Its name suggested how the civil rights and black power movements left behind terms such as African, colored and Negro. By 2013, the Census Bureau dropped the word from its surveys, NPR reported . President Barack Obama signed a law in 2016 that replaced \"Negro\" with \"African American,\" amending the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976\\n\\nCapitalizing the b in Black is not enough\\n\\nEducating teachers and school districts on Black history is paramount in making sure the change from black to Black is more than just a gesture, said Anyiwo, the developmental psychologist.\\n\\nRight now, Black history is integral to American history, but not a requirement to earn a degree in teaching, nor is it a required subject area for teacher certification exams such as the Praxis, said Valerie Adams-Bass , an assistant professor of Youth and Social Innovations in the Department of Human Services at the University of Virginia Curry School of Education.\\n\\nAdams-Bass has done research that shows how students with more Black history knowledge had higher career aspirations, she said.\\n\\n\"This is important because most Black children are taught by White and other non-Black teachers who often assume Black children are low achievers or dislike schools,\" she told CNN. \"Black children are also overlooked for AP courses and other opportunities that expose and prepare them for college based on racial bias. Having more Black history knowledge meant youth had high career aspirations, perhaps in spite of teacher perceptions.\"\\n\\nA big part of Black history is educating children on Black people that make up the fabric of American existence, Anyiwo said. Students must be exposed to the realities of how Black people in America were enslaved and subjugated to centuries of racial marginalization and oppression from the institution of slavery to Jim Crow laws to mass incarceration, she added.\\n\\n\"We cannot truly \\'capitalize\\' Black until we teach about how the beauty and power of Black resistance and advocacy for social justice have contributed to advances in the rights and freedoms of all Americans,\" Anyiwo said.\\n\\nCalifornia is one state that has already taken steps to address racial issues in its education system.\\n\\nThe state has some of the most teachers and students in the US, according to data from Educationdata.org and Brandman University . It\\'s also one of the largest markets for history textbooks, according to the New York Times\\n\\nFollowing Floyd\\'s death, state superintendent Tony Thurmond called on communities across California to take action to dismantle institutional racism and inequities in public schools and beyond, the California Department of Education (CDE) told CNN in an email.\\n\\n$500,000 grant was awarded to the CDE in June to fund the California Implicit Bias Training Initiative. This initiative involves experts training employees on implicit bias and racial justice, the CDE said in a news release. California is also considering a curriculum adjustment that would allow \"school districts to adapt their courses to better reflect the pupil demographics in their communities,\" the news release said\\n\\n\"The curriculum taught in our schools has not done enough to highlight and preserve the contributions of people of color and has actually minimized the importance of their role,\" the news release said. \"A movement to create a better model of inclusion to be taught in our K--12 system was established in the hopes of teaching a history that is more representative of what actually occurred. Ethnic studies as a whole should represent a broad range of topics, but it must devote a special emphasis to people of color, including their experiences and their important role in our state and national history.\"\\n\\nOne person heartened by these developments in K-12 education is Broussard, the history textbook author. Floyd\\'s death was a catalyst, he said.\\n\\n\"Change comes about slowly. This seems to be a more accelerated change than we\\'ve seen and almost a throwback to the 1960s,\" Broussard said. \"I\\'m happy and heartened. Frederick Douglass said over a hundred years ago, \\'Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\\' These are people out marching and protesting and raising their voices. And that has made all the difference in the world.\"',\n",

In ogni caso, se il programma dell\\'evento venisse modificato, Epic informerà tutti i giocatori il prima possibile.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.5 Formato dell\\'evento e punteggio\\n\\n\\n\\n2.5.1 Formato\\n\\n\\n\\nQualsiasi squadra terzetti idonea, come stabilito da Epic in accordo con questo Regolamento, può aspettare il proprio turno e partecipare alle qualificazioni della Competizione Campioni (\"Fase 1\" o \"Qualificazione\"). Le squadre verranno divise in due gruppi in base alla piattaforma di gioco utilizzata: (a) Gruppo PC oppure (b) Gruppo Console + Mobile (le squadre su PC verranno assegnate al Gruppo PC, mentre le squadre su Console e Mobile verranno assegnate al gruppo Console + Mobile). Durante l\\'evento, le squadre del gruppo PC non gareggeranno contro le squadre Console + Mobile e viceversa.\\n\\n\\n\\nPer il Round 1 della relativa Qualificazione (\"Round 1\"), tutti i terzetti idonei (come stabilito da Epic in accordo con il Regolamento) devono posizionarsi nella Lega campioni (Divisione I, II o III) o superiore all\\'interno dell\\'Arena nella loro rispettiva regione entro l\\'inizio della Qualificazione. In questo modo potranno aspettare il proprio turno e competere durante la rispettiva sessione regionale del Round 1, come elencato all\\'interno del gioco.\\n\\n\\n\\nOgni sessione del Round 1 ha una durata approssimativa di tre (3) ore. Le squadre possono giocare fino a un massimo di dieci (10) partite durante ciascuna sessione del Round 1. Le squadre guadagneranno punti in base al sistema di punteggio elencato nelle sezioni 2.5.2 e 2.5.3 (se applicabili). Le partite di una sessione del Round 1 verranno prese in considerazione solo nel caso in cui la partita inizi entro la finestra temporale della sessione.\\n\\n\\n\\nPer chiarezza, durante qualsiasi Round della Fase 1, le squadre possono partecipare alla Qualificazione di una sola regione e di un singolo gruppo piattaforma.\\n\\n\\n\\nAl termine del Round 1 della relativa Qualificazione, i giocatori di ogni regione server che hanno ottenuto il punteggio migliore proseguiranno (come stabilito nella sezione 2.5.5) e potranno aspettare il proprio turno per il Round 2 di quella Qualificazione (\"Round 2\"). Non sarà possibile accedere al Round 2 senza essersi classificati tra le migliori squadre di una regione durante il Round 1 di quelle qualificazioni.\\n\\n\\n\\nDurante il Round 2 della qualificazione applicabile, le squadre gareggeranno in una sessione singola durante la rispettiva finestra temporale del Round 2, come elencato all\\'interno del gioco. Ogni sessione del Round 2 ha una durata approssimativa di tre (3) ore. Le squadre possono giocare fino a un massimo di dieci (10) partite durante ciascuna sessione del Round 2. Le squadre guadagneranno punti in base al sistema di punteggio elencato nelle sezioni 2.5.2 e 2.5.3 (se applicabili). Le partite di una sessione del Round 2 verranno prese in considerazione solo nel caso in cui la partita inizi entro la finestra temporale della sessione.\\n\\n\\n\\nAl termine del Round 2 della relativa Qualificazione, i giocatori di ogni regione server che hanno ottenuto il punteggio migliore proseguiranno (come stabilito nella sezione 2.5.6) e potranno aspettare il proprio turno per il Round 3 di quella Qualificazione (\"Round 3\"). Non sarà possibile accedere al Round 3 senza essersi classificati tra le migliori squadre di una regione durante il Round 2 di quelle qualificazioni.\\n\\n\\n\\nNel Round 3 della qualificazione applicabile, le squadre gareggeranno in due (2) sessioni durante le rispettive finestre di sessione del Round 3, come elencato all\\'interno del gioco. I punti raccolti in ciascuna sessione saranno sommati per determinare il punteggio totale per il Round 3 della Qualificazione. Le squadre possono giocare fino a un massimo di sei (6) partite durante una sessione del Round 3, per un massimo di dodici (12) partite nell\\'arco del Round 3 della Qualificazione. Per ciascuna sessione del Round 3, la prima partita comincia dieci (10) minuti dopo l\\'apertura della sessione. Ciascuna sessione del Round 3 ha una durata approssimativa di tre (3) ore, e ogni trenta (30) minuti ha inizio una nuova partita. Se una squadra non riesce a mettersi in coda per la playlist e/o arriva a partita già cominciata, verrà considerato un piazzamento o un pareggio all\\'ultimo posto con nessuna eliminazione durante quella partita persa. Le squadre guadagneranno punti in base al sistema di punteggio elencato nelle sezioni 2.5.2, 2.5.3 o 2.5.4 (se applicabili). Le partite di una sessione del Round 3 verranno prese in considerazione solo nel caso in cui la partita inizi prima che la finestra temporale della sessione si chiuda.\\n\\n\\n\\nAl termine del Round 3 della relativa Qualificazione, le squadre di ogni regione server che hanno ottenuto il punteggio migliore proseguiranno (come stabilito nella sezione 2.5.7) e potranno aspettare il proprio turno per la seconda fase dell\\'Evento (\"Fase 2\" o \"Finali di stagione\") e/o riceveranno un premio come stabilito nella sezione 2.6. Non sarà possibile accedere alle Finali di stagione senza aver completato la Fase 1, come stabilito dal regolamento.\\n\\n\\n\\nInoltre, tutti i punti competizione assegnati al termine del Round 3 della relativa Qualificazione si cumuleranno nel corso delle altre tre (3) Qualificazioni. Le squadre di ogni regione server che al termine delle tre (3) sessioni del Round 3 avranno ottenuto il maggior numero di punti ma che ancora non sono entrate nella Fase 2, passeranno comunque alla Fase 2, come elencato nelle sezioni 2.5.7 o 2.5.8 (se applicabili). Per le squadre che (a) sono già passate alla Fase 2 durante una Qualificazione precedente e che (b) figurano nella classifica del Round 3 per passare alla Fase 2 in una o più Qualificazioni aggiuntive, i piazzamenti di avanzamento aggiuntivi verranno rimossi e poi sommati al conteggio di avanzamento finale, che sarà elaborato sulla base della classifica della competizione al termine della settimana 3.\\n\\n\\n\\nNel Round 1 delle Finali di stagione (\"Fase a gironi\"), le squadre saranno divise in batterie (ognuna denominata \"Batteria\") e gareggeranno in due (2) sessioni durante le finestre di sessione della Fase a gironi della rispettiva regione, come elencato all\\'interno del gioco. I punti raccolti in ciascuna sessione saranno sommati per determinare il punteggio totale per la Batteria. Le squadre possono giocare un massimo di sei (6) partite durante una sessione di Batteria, per un massimo di dodici (12) partite nell\\'arco della Batteria. In ciascuna sessione della Fase a gironi, la prima partita comincia dieci (10) minuti dopo l\\'apertura della sessione. Ciascuna sessione della Batteria ha una durata approssimativa di tre (3) ore, e ogni trenta (30) minuti ha inizio una nuova partita. Se una squadra non riesce a mettersi in coda per la playlist e/o arriva a partita già cominciata, verrà considerato un piazzamento o un pareggio all\\'ultimo posto, con nessuna eliminazione durante quella partita persa. Le squadre guadagneranno punti in base al sistema di punteggio elencato nelle sezioni 2.5.2 o 2.5.3 (se applicabili). Le partite per una batteria verranno prese in considerazione solo nel caso in cui la partita inizi prima che la finestra temporale di questa batteria si chiuda.\\n\\n\\n\\nPer chiarezza, durante la Fase a gironi, le squadre possono partecipare alla sessione di una sola regione e di un solo gruppo piattaforma.\\n\\n\\n\\nAl termine di ogni batteria, le squadre di quella batteria che hanno ottenuto il punteggio migliore proseguiranno (come stabilito nella sezione 2.5.9) e potranno aspettare il proprio turno per il Round 2 delle Finali di stagione (\"Gran Finale\") delle rispettive regioni. Le squadre che non passano alla Gran Finale dalle Batterie ma rientrano nei parametri elencati nella sezione 2.5.9 potranno invece aspettare il proprio turno per la Partita Wildcard (\"Partita Wildcard\") per ottenere un\\'ultima opportunità di accedere alla Gran Finale. Non sarà possibile accedere alla Gran Finale senza aver completato la Fase a gironi o la Partita Wildcard, come stabilito dal Regolamento.\\n\\n\\n\\nPer la Partita Wildcard, tutte le squadre idonee gareggeranno in una partita singola nel corso della finestra di sessione della rispettiva regione, come indicato nel gioco. La Partita Wildcard inizierà dieci (10) minuti dopo l\\'inizio della finestra di sessione e durerà approssimativamente trenta (30) minuti. Se una squadra non riesce a mettersi in coda per la playlist e/o arriva a Partita Wildcard già cominciata, verrà considerato un piazzamento o un pareggio all\\'ultimo posto. La squadra che ottiene la Vittoria reale per la Partita Wildcard passerà avanti e potrà mettersi in coda per la Gran Finale della rispettiva regione.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNella Gran Finale, le squadre gareggeranno in due (2) sessioni durante le rispettive sessioni regionali della Gran Finale, come elencato all\\'interno del gioco. I punti raccolti in ciascuna sessione saranno sommati per determinare il punteggio totale per la Gran Finale. Le squadre possono giocare fino a un massimo di sei (6) partite durante ciascuna sessione, per un totale di dodici (12) partite nel corso della Gran Finale. Ciascuna sessione della Gran Finale ha una durata approssimativa di tre (3) ore, e ogni trenta (30) minuti ha inizio una nuova partita. Se una squadra non riesce a mettersi in coda per la playlist e/o arriva a partita già cominciata, si piazzerà all\\'ultimo posto, con nessuna eliminazione durante quella partita persa. Le squadre guadagneranno punti in base al sistema di punteggio elencato nelle sezioni 2.5.2 o 2.5.3 (se applicabili). Le partite della Gran Finale verranno prese in considerazione solo nel caso in cui la partita inizi prima che la finestra temporale della sessione si chiuda.\\n\\n\\n\\nPer chiarezza, durante la Gran Finale i giocatori possono partecipare alla sessione di una sola regione e di un solo gruppo piattaforma.\\n\\n\\n\\nAl termine della Gran Finale, nel rispetto delle condizioni generali enunciate, le squadre con il miglior punteggio di ogni regione, come elencato nella classifica di gioco (\"Classifica\") riceveranno i premi come stabilito nella sezione 2.6.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.5.2 Sistema di punteggio\\n\\n\\n\\nPiazzamento\\n\\nVittoria reale: 25 punti\\n\\n2°: 20 punti\\n\\n3°: 16 punti\\n\\n4°: 14 punti\\n\\n5°: 13 punti\\n\\n6°: 12 punti\\n\\n7°: 11 punti\\n\\n8º: 10 punti\\n\\n9º: 9 punti\\n\\n10°: 8 punti\\n\\n11°: 7 punti\\n\\n12°: 6 punti\\n\\n13°: 5 punti\\n\\n14° - 4 punti\\n\\n15°: 3 punti\\n\\n16°: 2 punti\\n\\n17°: 1 punto\\n\\n\\n\\nOgni eliminazione: +1 punto\\n\\n\\n\\n2.5.3 Spareggi\\n\\n\\n\\nGli ex aequo verranno sciolti come segue: (1) punti totali raccolti, (2) Vittorie reali totali nella sessione, (3) media eliminazioni nella sessione, (4) piazzamento medio per partita nella sessione, (5) secondi di sopravvivenza totali in tutte le partite, e per finire (6) sorteggio.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.5.4 Sistema di punteggio dei punti competizione\\n\\n\\n\\nI punti competizione vengono assegnati a tutte le squadre, a prescindere dal piazzamento in classifica, al termine del Round 3 di ogni sfida Settimanale. Per chiarezza, le squadre riceveranno i punti competizione solo per i Round a cui avranno effettivamente partecipato. A titolo di esempio, se una squadra raggiunge il Round 3 ma non riesce a mettersi in coda o comunque non partecipa a nessuna partita durante una sessione del Round 3, riceverà solo i punti competizione delle partite a cui ha partecipato durante il Round 2 (dove applicabile).\\n\\n\\n\\n1° posto - 500 punti competizione\\n\\n2° posto - 476 punti competizione\\n\\n3° posto - 452 punti competizione\\n\\n4° posto - 428 punti competizione\\n\\n5° posto - 408 punti competizione\\n\\n6° posto - 386 punti competizione\\n\\n7° posto - 368 punti competizione\\n\\n8° posto - 350 punti competizione\\n\\n9° posto - 332 punti competizione\\n\\n10º posto - 316 punti competizione\\n\\n11°-15º posto - 300 punti competizione\\n\\n16°-20° posto - 284 punti competizione\\n\\n21°-25° posto - 270 punti competizione\\n\\n26°-50° posto - 244 punti competizione\\n\\n51°-75° posto - 218 punti competizione\\n\\n76°-100° posto - 196 punti competizione\\n\\n101°-125° posto - 178 punti competizione\\n\\n126°-150° posto - 160 punti competizione\\n\\n151°-175° posto - 144 punti competizione\\n\\n176°-200° posto - 130 punti competizione\\n\\n201°-250° posto - 110 punti competizione\\n\\n251°-350° posto - 94 punti competizione\\n\\n351°-700° posto - 70 punti competizione\\n\\n701°-1000° posto - 52 punti competizione\\n\\n1001°-1500° posto - 40 punti competizione\\n\\n1501°-2000° posto - 30 punti competizione\\n\\n2001°-3000° posto - 22 punti competizione\\n\\n3001°-5000° posto - 16 punti competizione\\n\\n5001°-10000° posto - 10 punti competizione\\n\\n\\n\\n2.5.5 Avanzamento al Round 2\\n\\n\\n\\nL\\'avanzamento dal Round 1 al Round 2 dipenderà dai punti guadagnati al termine del Round 1 della relativa Qualificazione.

Nessun giocatore con un punteggio inferiore ai vincitori avrà diritto, in nessun momento e in nessuna circostanza, a premi collegati all\\'evento.\\n\\n\\n\\nPer chiarezza, i premi vengono assegnati nella formula \"visto e piaciuto\" senza alcun tipo di garanzia, esplicita o implicita. I premi non sono né trasferibili né assegnabili e non possono essere trasferiti dai Giocatori vincitori. I premi non in denaro (se presenti) non possono essere monetizzati. Tutti i dettagli relativi ai premi sono a esclusiva discrezione di Epic. L\\'uso e l\\'accettazione dei premi sono soggetti alle condizioni generali enunciate.\\n\\n\\n\\nI giocatori con i punteggi più alti riceveranno una notifica del proprio stato di potenziali Giocatori vincitori all\\'indirizzo e-mail associato all\\'account Epic entro 7 giorni dal termine dell\\'Evento o altro periodo ragionevolmente necessario a Epic per detta notifica e saranno soggetti a verifica di idoneità secondo la sezione 3 e in conformità con il Regolamento. Un potenziale vincitore deve mantenere attivo l\\'account Epic che ha usato per competere all\\'Evento durante tutto il processo di verifica di idoneità.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuando il potenziale vincitore riceverà formale notifica da parte di Epic, avrà 45 giorni dalla data d\\'invio dell\\'e-mail di notifica per rispondere e fornire le eventuali informazioni o i materiali richiesti da Epic, inclusa la liberatoria (come definita più sotto) allo scopo di verificare l\\'idoneità ai termini della sezione 3. La risposta del potenziale giocatore vincitore dovrà essere inviata all\\'indirizzo e-mail da cui è stata spedita la notifica di Epic oppure, a esclusiva discrezione di Epic, a un altro indirizzo e-mail specificato nella notifica. La data di ricezione da parte di Epic sarà decisiva ai fini della conformità di un potenziale vincitore alle scadenze stabilite nella presente sezione 2.6.5.\\n\\n\\n\\nQualora un giocatore (a) non mantenesse attivo l\\'account Epic che ha usato per competere all\\'Evento durante il processo di verifica di idoneità o (b) non rispondesse tempestivamente a eventuali notifiche o richieste di materiali e informazioni, potrebbe essere squalificato come vincitore e non avrà diritto ad alcun premio di beneficenza relativo all\\'Evento. In tal caso, nessun Giocatore vincitore alternativo verrà designato ed Epic avrà il diritto, a sua esclusiva e assoluta discrezione, di (y) utilizzare eventuali vincite del giocatore squalificato per futuri eventi competitivi di Fortnite, oppure (z) donare tali vincite in beneficenza. Un giocatore vincitore verrà considerato tale solo al termine del processo di verifica di idoneità da parte di Epic ai sensi del presente Regolamento.\\n\\n\\n\\nPer ricevere il premio, i giocatori vincitori dovranno inoltre fornire a Epic determinati dati per il pagamento, compresi eventuali moduli fiscali obbligatori. Epic potrà decidere di non procedere con il pagamento del premio Epic qualora un giocatore vincitore non provveda a fornire tempestivamente i moduli necessari.\\n\\n\\n\\nI PREMI EPIC SONO SOGGETTI ALLE IMPOSTE INTERNAZIONALI, FEDERALI, LOCALI E STATALI (INCLUSE, A TITOLO ESEMPLIFICATIVO, LE IMPOSTE SUL REDDITO E LA RITENUTA D\\'IMPOSTA) ED È RESPONSABILITÀ DI CIASCUN GIOCATORE VINCITORE (I) CONTROLLARE CON IL PROPRIO COMMERCIALISTA LA DETERMINAZIONE DELLE IMPOSTE APPLICABILI E (II) PAGARE TALI TASSE ALL\\'AGENZIA DELLE ENTRATE PERTINENTE. La politica di Epic è quella di eseguire la ritenuta delle tasse ai tassi di ritenuta in vigore per i residenti USA e non. L\\'imposta sul reddito e la ritenuta d\\'imposta relative al premio saranno comunicate mediante i moduli (y) 1099-MISC per i residenti negli Stati Uniti e 1042-S per i non residenti negli Stati Uniti, nonché (z) mediante ogni altro eventuale modulo fiscale richiesto dalla legge vigente.\\n\\n\\n\\nEpic determinerà la modalità di pagamento dei premi a sua esclusiva discrezione e, fatto salvo quanto richiesto dalla legislazione applicabile, tutti i pagamenti saranno effettuati direttamente al Giocatore vincitore come singolo individuo (o al suo genitore o tutore legale nel caso di un minore). A scanso di ogni possibile equivoco, Epic non effettuerà pagamenti di premi a beneficio di organizzazioni, aziende o altre entità. Il Giocatore vincitore riceverà un Modulo di accettazione del premio e liberatoria (\"Liberatoria\"). Fatti salvi i limiti imposti dalla legge vigente in materia, il Giocatore vincitore (o il suo genitore o tutore legale nel caso di un minore) dovrà compilare e restituire la Liberatoria conformemente alle scadenze stabilite nella sezione 2.6.5.\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Idoneità del giocatore\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 Età del giocatore\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.1 Per poter partecipare a una partita della Competizione Campioni, un giocatore deve avere dai 13 anni in su (o altra soglia d\\'età, se maggiore, eventualmente richiesta nel paese di residenza di tale giocatore). Se il giocatore ha un\\'età inferiore ai 18 anni o all\\'età definita come maggiore età dal proprio paese di residenza (\"Minorenne\"), dovrà ricevere l\\'autorizzazione di un genitore o tutore legale per partecipare all\\'Evento.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.2 I giocatori non idonei che inganneranno o cercheranno d\\'ingannare gli Amministratori dell\\'evento fornendo informazioni false sulla loro idoneità saranno sottoposti alle azioni disciplinari descritte nella sezione 9.2.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 EULA di Fortnite\\n\\n\\n\\nOgni giocatore deve attenersi al Contratto di licenza per l\\'utente finale di Fortnite.

              " 'I While a lot of us dream of changing the world, the reality is, few of us will get the chance to do so. However, those who do create drastic changes tend to do so in politics, governance, and in Elon Musks case, technology and science. Elon is known by many as the Tony Stark (referring to the Marvel comic book superhero genius, playboy, and philanthropist, Iron Man) of our time. II Born in South Africa in 1971, Elon Musk started his technological journey at an early age. At 12 years old, Elon taught himself computer programming and soon after, was able to create a video game called Blastar, which he sold for $500. III It seems Stanford didnt impress Elon that much as he left after just two days there! His reasoning was that he wanted to ride the wave of the internet, which was at a critical stage at the time. Elon established Zip2, his first company, which was a source of online newspapers, maps, and directories for businesses. He sold this company for $307 million in 1999. IV He would do this another time after co-founding X.com, the predecessor of online payment company, Paypal. This time, the company was sold to eBay for a whopping $1.5 billion. However, Elon only claimed $165 million of the total sale price. After these two big developments, Elon was poised to found the companies that would cement his reputation as the Tony Stark of the real world. V Elon co-founded Tesla Motors, an electric sports car company named after Nikola Tesla that has changed the way people perceive electric cars. Next, he founded Space Exploration Technologies, now commonly known as SpaceX, whose aim is to make space exploration affordable. VI While Elon may be a genius, both companies came very close to bankruptcy and failure due to numerous production and development problems. Despite the setbacks, Elon pressed on and succeeded. Teslas Model S has the highest safety rating ever given to a car at 5.4. Elon was also responsible for reducing the cost of reaching the International Space Station from $1 billion per mission to $60 million.\\n\\nI If laughter is the best medicine, then comedians are the most amazing healers around. And when it comes to healing through the power of comedy, these days very few can come close to the highly potent material that actor-comedian Kevin Hart dishes out. II Kevin Darnell Hart, born on July 6, 1979, started out with a life that, for most people, would make them think of anything but comedy. His dad, a cocaine addict, was in and out of jail, leaving his mother Nancy to raise him and his brother Robert all by herself. It III His early life was nothing out of the ordinary. Kevin went to high-school and attended a community college before finally finding a job. In his case, Kevin moved to Brockton, Massachusetts and became a shoe salesman. According to Kevin, he was quite good at slinging shoes. IV Standing at just 52 (a feature he has turned into many a successful joke at his own expense) with a naturally pleasing demeanor, Kevin was poised to take the comedy world by storm. He started his career in an amateur club in Philadelphia The Laff House as Lil Kev. But he bombed, big time, being booed off the stage numerous times. He was even hit by a piece of chicken. V In true Kevin Hart fashion, he didnt quit. He kept going and entered a number of comedy contests all around Massachusetts. Not long after, he found his own groove and stopped trying to copy predecessors like Chris Tucker. Hart used his own problems, life stories, and insecurities, which became his signature style and the factor that would go on to bring him great success. VI As his renown grew, Hart went on comedy tours, starting with Im a Grown Little Man in 2009. What followed is a series of comedy tours that would bring him even more fame. But he didnt stop there. He also went into TV and film, with his break out role being a guest appearance in the series Undeclared.\\n\\nI Years ago, nerds and geeks were seen as not cool, and often made fun of in school, at work, and even on movies and in TV shows. Things became different in recent years, however, as the perception of geeks and nerds changed for the better. One show that definitely contributed to this, is The Big Bang Theory; and its star, Jim Parsons, was at the forefront of this change. II James Joseph Parsons, born March 24, 1973, is a native of Houston, Texas. Coincidentally, this is very similar to his character, Sheldon Cooper, in The Big Bang Theory. The road to playing this iconic character started out in his very first school play, where Jim was cast as a bird. III Growing up, young Jim was inspired and influenced by a number of sitcoms, the most notable of which were Threes Company, Family Ties, and The Cosby Show. He was so determined to pursue acting, in fact, that during his three years at the University of Houston, he starred in a total of 17 plays, honing his talent and craft. IV So, when it came time to audition for the character Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory, Jim brought all his talents to bear. He was so impressive that Chuck Lorre, producer and writer of the show, couldnt believe how perfect for the role he was. V This breakout role became a major milestone for Jim. He was nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards and Golden Globe awards for six years straight from 2009 to 2014, winning in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014. Not only that, but his earnings per episode rose from $325,000 during 2013, to $1 million in 2014 for the eighth, ninth, and tenth seasons. VI After many achievements such as receiving his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and playing God in the Broadway production An Act of God in 2015 Jim decided to leave The Big Bang Theory in 2019 to focus on other projects such as Broadway plays, serious dramas, and the next chapter of his life. With his departure came the end of the show.\\n\\nI Game of Thrones was one of the biggest, most epic TV series ever aired. Many of the shows cast became instant Hollywood A-listers during and after its eight-season run on HBO. But being one of the main characters known variously as the Bastard, the King in the North, Jon Snow Kit Harrington became a household name the world over. II Born on December 26, 1986, Kit Harrington only found out that his real name was actually Christopher when he was already 11 years old. He has always gone by the name Kit, similar to famed playwright Christopher Kit Marlowe, whom he was named after. Kits mom, Deborah Jane Catesby, is also a playwright. III That meant that Kits rise to superstardom would naturally begin on-stage as well. His first major role was playing the lead in the National Theatre Companys original production of War Horse, where his skills, honed after many years, went on full display. It was during his run as the lead of the play that he caught the eye of the producers of Game of Thrones. IV Funnily enough, Kits involvement in the franchise didnt start here. As a young man, Kit worked in a bookshop, and he hated carrying A Song of Ice and Fire books, which are, of course, the books on which Game of Thrones is based. He never couldve imagined that years later, he would play the role of the series pivotal lead character, Jon Snow. V But its not just Jon Snow who has royal blood and is the descendant of a noble family (spoiler alert!) Kit Harrington also has a royal lineage. He is a descendant of King Charles II through his paternal grandmother, his father is a knighted baronet. VI In true Prince Charming fashion, even Kits personal love life is one for the books. On the set of Game of Thrones, Kit met actress Rose Leslie, who played Jon Snows love interest Ygritte during season two. Kit claims that he fell in love in Iceland, where the two actors filmed most of their scenes. Jon and Rose eventually got married in 2018.\\n\\nI To make the most out of your empty cereal boxes, use them to make Cereal Box Notepads! All you need are a few materials: cereal boxes or other cardboard, a wide paintbrush, mod podge, two paint stir sticks, two large binder clips, a paper cutter or Exacto knife, a ruler, and paper. II First, decide on what size your notepad will be depending on the type of paper you have. You can choose from an existing notepad, notecards, binder paper, or paper cut-ups from an old composition book. Using an Exacto knife or a paper cutter, cut your paper to the size you want. III Have a look through the boxes you\\'ve collected and pick the one you want to use. Then cut out the cardboard box to match the size of the paper you are using. Cut out a section for both the front and back of your notepad using the Exacto knife or paper cutter. IV Sandwich all your paper in between the two cardboard cutouts and line them up nicely until the edges are even. Now place the paint stir sticks on the front and back of your notepad and secure with binder clips. This will hold everything in place while you use the glue to bind the top. V Remove one of the binder clips and apply an even coat of Mod Podge on the edge. Take your binder clip and move it to the side you just glued, taking care to make sure that the top isn\\'t touching the glue. Then do the other side and let everything dry. VI Repeat this process two more times to give your notebook a total of three coats. Once it has dried, you can remove the clips and stir sticks and enjoy! These rustic notebooks make a great gift, or you can use them to jot down quite notes.\\n\\nI Anyone who has problems organizing their desks would benefit from (and love) this DIY cereal box organizer. Its easy to make and youll be saving so much by not having to buy an organizer from an office supply store. Perhaps the best part is that you can make this using any old box youre no longer using, which means youre helping the planet by recycling. II You will need to gather a few of your old cereal boxes, snack boxes, or any kind of boxes you have at home. If you dont have any, its best to save them until you have as many as you need. You will also need a paper cutter, wrapping paper, and mod podge or glue. III While many people decide to spend big on conventional desk organizers, this is an alternative that is just as functional but far more cost-effective. Besides, why spend money on something no-one will see anyway? After all, desk organizers are supposed to be hidden inside desks, right? IV To get started, measure out the depth of your drawer, so you know what size to cut your box. Decide on the layout you need and cut your cardboard to size so that all the pieces fit when the drawer is closed. Then, take out all the contents of your drawer and arrange the boxes inside until they all fit. V Now, take your wrapping paper (which you can easily find at a dollar shop) and measure it against the boxes, making sure you allow space for the paper to cover the whole box because its not very nice to see brown cardboard or colors that dont match each other. VI Then, using mod podge, glue the edges of the paper down first, then cut out longer pieces of wrapping paper to cover any spaces in between that werent covered. Glue the paper in place. It may not be perfect and you may have a few wrinkles, but no-one is going to see these details. Repeat the gluing process for all your boxes and youre done!\\n\\nI Desserts will never be entirely off the menu, no matter how many health kicks you go on. Every party has different types of foods, and desserts always have their place. Having them presented beautifully makes them look even more enticing and delicious. This doesnt only depend upon the arrangement, but will also involve some decorations such as a cake stand. II The wonderful thing about cake stands is that you can make one of your own and have it customized to your personal dessert preferences. To make a cake stand, you will need these materials: three round wooden discs in different sizes (4, 5 and 11), acrylic paint, wood stain, wood glue, a sanding block, a turned furniture leg, and a food-safe sealer. III The first thing to do is place the 4 wooden disc above the 5 one. Youre going to use wood glue to secure them together. In case youve added too much glue, make sure that the excess is wiped off before it dries. IV Next, apply wood glue to the bottom of the furniture leg. Hold it above the 4 wood round and make sure that you place it in the center. When everything is finally dry, apply wood glue above the furniture leg and place the 11 wood round on top. Add some heavy objects to the surface to compress the pieces together until they dry. V With the stand assembled, its time to decorate it. You can paint it with the colors of your choice, carve in additional designs, or simply coat it with a wood conditioner. Depending on how creative you are, you can take care of these design features yourself, or outsource them. VI Finally, sand the whole stand until you achieve the smooth texture you desire. Make sure you dont overdo it but that the surfaces are all smooth and even. Wipe away the dust with a damp cloth and then coat the stand with the food-safe sealer. Your cake stand is now ready to use for all your desserts, whether you have cupcakes, muffins, cookies, or cakes!\\n\\nI Over the decades, Ellen DeGeneres has truly made a name for herself. She is one of the most beloved comedians of her time, with her very own talk show to boot. Ellen was born in Louisiana in 1958. Her parents divorced when Ellen was a teenager. II The comedian initially wanted to be a veterinarian but according to her, she wasn\\'t \"book smart\". Her brother was considered the funny one in the family, but Ellen surprised everyone at a public speaking event where she used humor to overcome her fears. That was the moment her standup career commenced. III Her self-titled sitcom quickly became a hit. However, in 1997, she received major backlash after coming out on-air as a homosexual. It was so bad that an affiliate in ABC did not air the episode in Birmingham, Alabama. Daimler Chrysler even dropped out from sponsoring the show to avoid the controversy. IV In 1980, DeGeneres was living with her 23-year old girlfriend, Kat Perkoff. That same year, she lost Perkoff to a car accident. This experience, while extremely traumatic for 22-year-old DeGeneres, inspired the famous Phone call to God routine. This bit was about Ellen wanting an explanation from God as to why her girlfriend had to die while fleas are allowed to thrive. V In 2004, DeGeneres went on to date actress Portia de Rossi. The couple tied the knot four years later, on August 16, 2008, right after California legalized gay marriage. The wedding was perhaps the most famous gay marriage in history. Portia then legally changed her name to Portia Lee James DeGeneres in 2010. VI Ellens self-titled talk show first aired in 2003 and became an instant hit among daytime viewers. The show has received numerous awards ever since. She was also nominated for two Emmys for her stand-up special, Ellen DeGeneres: Here and Now. By 2018, DeGeneres net worth was estimated at $275 million. Today, Ellen remains the most famous lesbian role model in history.\\n\\nI Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28, 1986, to an Italian American family. Today, she is best known as Lady Gaga, the singer-songwriter and amazing performer who never fails to wow us with her extravagant and eccentric outfits. Her powerful vocals and thought-provoking lyrics earned her a great deal of success. Then, in the film, A Star is Born, Gaga managed to impress us with her incredible acting chops. II Germanotta was exposed to music at a very young age. When she was a teenager, she started performing in various clubs in New York City. At the same time, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, an exclusive school for girls in Manhattan, and went on to pursue studies in music at the Tisch School of Arts. However, she dropped out after two years in order to begin her career in music. III While she has numerous Oscar and Grammy awards under her belt, Lady Gaga was not immune to bullying. Back in college, a bunch of her schoolmates created a Facebook group named Stefani Germanotta, youll never be famous. The group, which has since been disbanded (for obvious reasons), had 12 members. Gaga has always been very open about how she suffered from bullying not just in university, but in high school as well. She even shared that despite all the fame, success, and money, the trauma doesnt ever really go away. IV It was during Germanottas transition from college girl to professional artist that Lady Gaga was born. The stage name was derived from the Queen song, Radio Ga Ga. Her music style is edgy, theatrical, and up-tempo. Her fashion sense is eccentric glam rock, styled by her very own creative team, Haus of Gaga. Apart from composing her own music, she also wrote songs for various pop icons such as Britney Spears, The Pussycat Dolls, and Fergie. V Lady Gagas first single was Just Dance, which was a smash hit in clubs. It topped the Billboard Pop Songs chart along with three more of her singles, LoveGame, Paparazzi, and Poker Face. This achievement made Gaga the first singer in 17 years to have four songs from an album top the charts. Her debut album sold over eight million copies in 2009 and earned her two Grammy awards: best dance recording for Poker Face, and best electronic/dance album. VI Apart from her successful music career, Lady Gaga also has an impressive list of acting gigs under her belt. Her performance in the TV anthology, American Horror Story: Hotel earned her a Golden Globe award. She also had her very first lead role in the 2018 remake of the film, A Star is Born. Gaga was praised for her raw performance as the innocent singer-songwriter, Ally. Gaga also won two Grammys and an Oscar for the films single, Shallow.\\n\\nI Eighties heartthrob Keanu Reeves is currently experiencing a renaissance in his professional career, not just in Hollywood, but also on the internet. Beloved by nearly everyone who shares memes online, Keanu Reeves story is one full of challenges, tragedy, and hope. He is a living testament to the fact that with the right mindset, one can rise above difficulties in life. II Keanu is a true man of the world. He was born in Beirut, Lebanon, and has Portuguese, English, Irish, and even Chinese and Native Hawaiian heritage. In fact, the name Keanu means the soft breeze raising in the native Hawaiian language. His name is so unconventional that he almost couldnt start a Hollywood career with it and thought of changing it back when he was trying to win his first roles. III When he started his acting career, Keanu took small parts and starred in some commercials. His first hit was Bill & Teds Excellent Adventure, which is now finally going to get a third installment, 30+ years after the sequel. His breakout role in the movie Speed sent him on a path to stardom, eventually working alongside heavy hitters like Al Pacino. IV But when he starred in the sci-fi hit The Matrix, and both the films sequels, Keanu cemented his legacy in Hollywood as one of the most bankable stars in modern times. However, he became even more famous, years later, when it was revealed that he took a pay cut from The Matrix movies so the producers could afford to make better special effects. V Other stories started to surface, from tragic ones like losing both his daughter and his girlfriend within the span of 15 months in 2000-2001, to putting his career on hold to take care of his sister Kim, to more recent news like helping passengers of a flight that had to make an emergency landing in Bakersfield, California to their destinations. VI These days, after starring in three successful John Wick films, and multiple acts of charity and humility captured by people and posted online, Keanu Reeves has become one of the most beloved celebrities on the internet. Hes so in touch with fans that the famous Sad Keanu meme prompted him to make a funny grown-up picture book called An Ode to Happiness.\\n\\nI Considered by many to be the Godfather of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Robert Downey Jr. is currently enjoying life in the upper echelons of Hollywood after his iconic run as comic book superhero Iron Man (aka, Tony Stark). But his road to success was filled with many twists and turns. It is an inspiring story of the rise, fall, and redemption of a great man. II Robert Downey Jr.s parents, Robert Sr. and Elsie, are a director and an actress respectively. So, he was born to be in Hollywood. Downey Jr. started out quite early, starring as a puppy in his dads movie Pound in 1970. From then on, despite being a high-school dropout, Robert Downey Jr.s acting career went on a steady rise. III While his future seemed bright, his early exposure to Hollywood stardom had a darker side. It is reported that as early as eight years old, Robert Downey Jr. was introduced to drugs by his own father. And despite having a sparkling career on the outside, behind the scenes he fell into a vicious cycle of addiction that resulted in him being arrested multiple times from 1996 to 2001. IV After being fired from the comedy-drama series Ally McBeal and being arrested for a final time in 2001, Robert Downey Jr. spent the next two years clawing his way out of his addiction, using multiple methods like yoga, meditation, and an ultimatum from his wife, Susan. Despite finding stability and sobriety, for a while there, Robert could not find work. He was considered a risk and the studios didnt want to pay the high insurance bonds needed. V It wasnt until fellow actor Mel Gibson underwrote Roberts liability insurance that he was finally able to star in a movie again The Singing Detective. This was followed by other successful movies like Gothika, A Scanner Darkly, and Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang. But it wasnt until he donned the mantle of the Marvel superhero Iron Man that his star power shone its brightest during his comeback run. VI Since then, Downey Jr. has been integral to Marvels Avengers franchise, starred in two sequels of Iron Man, took supporting roles in other Marvel movies, and starred in a string of other hits like Tropic Thunder and two Sherlock Holmes movies. The embattled star went from a studio pariah to being one of the most in-demand actors of the modern era. A true Hollywood comeback story.\\n\\nI Michael B. Jordan may have a name that is almost exactly like the basketball legends, but he is a star in his own right. Jordan has already played many outstanding roles, but he is just getting started. His meteoric rise as one of Hollywoods most bankable actors is going full steam ahead and shows no signs of slowing down. II Michael B. Jordan has quite an interesting name. The B stands for Bakari, a Swahili word which means of noble promise. Although it is quite a cool name, Michael says he wont pass it on if he has a son one day. III One tradition he might pass on to his kids is his newly established love of acting. Interestingly, Jordan initially had no plans to be an actor. One day, however, after a doctors appointment, Michael and his mom came across someone whose children were modeling. Inspired, Michael started going to auditions, and with his natural talent, he almost immediately started getting booked over and over for commercials. IV When he got a part in the hit TV series The Sopranos, however, Michael started to aim higher, auditioning for bigger and better parts. One particular role made such a big impact that even though his character was only there for one season, his performance is still talked about today. That role was 16-year-old drug dealer Wallace, of the show The Wire. V Given how successful hes been, you may be surprised to learn that, in the beginning, Michael almost quit acting when he suffered rejection after rejection. One person helped him get back on track, however: his co-star in The Wire Andre Royo. Andre changed his perspective by reminding him just how young he still was, and that he had actually had better luck than most. Jordan turned his perspective around and the success he sought soon followed. VI It wasn\\'t all easy though. In the midst of a superhero movie golden age, Michael B. Jordan was cast as the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four reboot in 2015. The movie was a complete disaster, panned by critics and comic fans alike. However, Michael made his mark and was cast in another superhero movie, this time as the villain Killmonger, in the hit Black Panther.\\n\\nI From being the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to one of the most bankable Hollywood actors in the past 30 years, Will Smith has created a legacy that now extends to his children, all of whom are also stars on the rise. And today, Will Smith has managed to personally keep up with the times, connecting to newer generations of fans all over the world. II Before landing the lead role in The Fresh Prince, Will Smith had already been rapping from as early as 12 years old, inspired by his favorite rapper, Grandmaster Flash. He sought to entertain everyone around him, and even used his charm to get out of trouble multiple times during high school, earning him the nickname The Prince. III This moniker would carry on in his early music career, where he teamed up with Jeff Townes as DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince. Unlike most rappers of that era, Will Smith kept his lyrics wholesome and clean, singing about more casual and friendly topics instead of the usual sex, money, and drugs. This endeared him to many and led to the creation of the show, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. IV It was a huge success, running for six seasons and 148 episodes, and made Will a millionaire before the age of 20. And after two successful movies in the mid-90s, namely Bad Boys and Independence Day, with the former being his first-ever film, Will Smith instantly became one of Hollywood\\'s most sought-after and highest-paid actors. V After a string of hits, playing both comedic and dramatic roles with no flop movie under his belt, Will Smith was on top of the world. He became the first star in the history of Hollywood to have eight movies in a row exceeding $100 million in gross earnings. And he has even dipped his feet into the giant comic-book based movie genre, playing Deadshot in Suicide Squad. VI Smith opened up, sharing his personal flaws and shortcomings with his wife, Jada Pinkett-Smith, on her online show, Red Table Talk. Will Smith showed his softer, more vulnerable side to the world, and earned a new generation of fans in the process. Today, after his role as the genie if the live-action remake of Aladdin, it seems that he will gain even more.\\n\\nI When Disney announced the live-action remake of their classic animated movie Mulan, fans held their collective breaths in anticipation of who would be cast in the titular role. And when the word came out that an actress named Liu Yifei got the part, people scrambled to find out who she was. II Liu Yifei, or Crystal Liu as she is known in English-speaking countries, was born in Hubei, China, on August 25, 1987. That makes her 32 years old already, although her youthful appearance would say otherwise! While her name may not be familiar, shes enjoyed quite a bit of success prior to landing the role of Mulan, having started acting at the age of 15. III Yifei has experienced living in the Western world. When she was younger, she studied in New York for a few years before heading to the Beijing Film Academy\\'s Performance Institute. And in addition to speaking fluent English and Chinese, she also speaks Japanese and Korean. IV In fact, shes so well-versed in Japanese that she actually released a Japanese album because, in addition to being an actress, Yifei is also a singer. Sony Music Entertainment signed Yifei back in 2006, just after her Japanese album release. Fun fact: one of her singles, Mayonaka no Doa, became Japanese anime Powerpuff Girl Zs theme song. V Speaking of international reach, Yifei is also no stranger to Hollywood. She has actually appeared in a number of Hollywood movies, the most notable of which was The Forbidden Kingdom in 2008. This movie also starred two other Asian superstars, Jackie Chan and Jet Li. In addition, she appeared in Outcast in 2014 along with Nicholas Cage and Hayden Christensen, and The Chinese Widow with Emile Hirsch in 2017. VI And with the live-action Mulan set to be released very soon, Yifeis star could very well shine even brighter. But with the recent pro-democracy protests happening in Hong Kong, and Yifeis open support for the Hong Kong police and China with her recent online tweets, the Mulan movie faces a potential boycott; something that Yifei might have inadvertently caused.\\n\\nI Norma Jeane Mortenson was born on June 1, 1926, in Los Angeles. She never met her father, and her mother, Gladys, suffered from a mental condition. As such, little Norma Jeane had to be placed in a foster home where she lived until she was seven. Her foster parents, Albert and Ida Bolender, were extremely religious, and thus were very strict with her. She briefly lived with her mother in 1933, but Gladys was admitted to a rest home a year later due to mental instability. II In 1934, Norma Jeane was put under the care of Grace McKee, Gladys\\'s good friend. Grace had high hopes for Norma Jeane and even told her that she was going to be an important woman and a movie star someday. Since her new foster mother was a huge fan of Jean Harlow, a 1920s superstar, she became Norma Jeane\\'s idol as well. In 1935, Grace suffered from financial problems, so Norma Jeane had to be placed in an orphanage. Grace regularly visited. III For several years, Norma Jeane lived with a few of Grace\\'s family members. It was a very grim period for the young girl. She shared how she felt as if the world was closed off to her. She had to live in a pretend fantasy world in order to escape her grim reality. In 1941, she met Jim Dougherty, a man five years older than her. Grace, whom she was living with once again, encouraged their relationship. IV Grace was so enthusiastic about the relationship that she arranged for Norma Jeane to be married to Dougherty on June 19, 1942. According to Monroe, she had little choice in the matter. Back then, Grace had no money and badly needed someone who could support Norma Jeane. In 1943, Dougherty joined the Marines. Meanwhile, Norma Jeane started working in a factory. V In 1946, Norma Jeane divorced her husband. While there was never really any conflict between the two, they just didnt love each other. Norma Jeane explained how they barely even talked to each other not out of anger, but just because they had nothing in common. Basically, the marriage bored the young girl to death. VI In July 1946, Norma Jeane signed a contract with Fox. Monroe was her mother\\'s maiden name, and she dropped Norma Jeane in favor of Marilyn which she thought to be more glamorous. She started her career with minor roles in films. In 1947, she sang for the very first time in the film, Ladies of the Chorus. In a controversial move, Monroe posed nude for a calendar in 1949. She was then quoted as saying, \"...Hollywood will pay you $1,000 for a kiss, and 50 cents for your soul.\"\\n\\nI On January 29, 1954, Vernita Lee gave birth to her daughter, Oprah Gail Winfrey. She was supposed to be named Orpah, after the character from the bible. However, people found it tricky to pronounce and spell, so she ended up being Oprah. Her parents separated just a short while after she was born. She had to be placed in the care of her grandmother on a farm in Kosciusko, Mississippi. II Young Oprah enjoyed putting on performances for her friends. Her grandmother was very strict but it also pushed her to start reading by the age of two. She wrote a note to her kindergarten teacher telling her that she was ready to be in the first grade. So, Oprah skipped kindergarten that year and was accelerated to third grade the following year. III When Oprah was six, she moved back in with her mother and two half-brothers in an impoverished neighborhood. She briefly lived with her father in Nashville, Tennessee when she was 12. During this time, she started delivering speeches at various church gatherings. She was even paid $500 for a speech one time. Since then, she knew that her calling was to get paid to talk. IV While she could see a bright future forming, these childhood years were tough for Oprah. When she was nine years old and living with her mother, Oprah was sexually abused repeatedly by friends of the family. Since her mother had to work several jobs, she did not have the luxury to watch over her daughter. On finding out what was happening, Oprah\\'s mother decided to have her move back with her father where she would be safe. V Winfrey shared how she was brought up by her strict father. Her dad gave her life structure through guidance and rules. She had to accomplish one book report per week and was not allowed to eat dinner until she learned five new words. This helped Oprah become an outstanding student. She was part of the student council, drama club, and debate club. She received a full university scholarship to Tennessee State University when she won a speaking contest. VI During her freshman year at Tennessee State, she won Miss Black Nashville and Miss Tennessee. She was offered a job at the Nashville Columbia Broadcasting System, which she turned down twice. But upon her teachers advice, she finally accepted the third offer. At 19, she became the first African American female co-anchor of Tennessee.\\n\\nI There was nothing funny about Jim Carreys childhood. He hailed from a poor family in Newmarket, Canada. James Eugene Carrey was born on January 17, 1962, to Percy and Kathleen. He had three older siblings: Rita, John, and Patricia. The familys patriarch was a Catholic who worked as an accountant. Young Jim briefly studied in a Catholic school in North York and then moved to Agincourt Collegiate School. He transferred to another school after a year. II Carreys family moved to Burlington when he was a teenager. There, he once again pursued his studies at the Aldershot High School. He loved entertaining his classmates by performing stand-up comedy. Inspired by their reactions, he made a decision to do comedy for a living. He started performing at a comedy bar in Toronto called Yuk Yuks. His first stand-up performance bombed, but he wasnt deterred. He continued to perform on stage, making a living out of his passion. III Carrey auditioned for Saturday Night Live in 1980 but got rejected. Still determined to make it big, he focused on auditioning for Hollywood films. A year later, a stand-up comedy show that was aired on TV featured one of Carreys bits. In 1983, he had a guest spot on The Tonight Show and was cast in the films Copper Mountain and Rubberface. Several more movies and TV shows later, he finally got his big break in 1994, when he was cast as the lead star of the comedy film, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. IV Before all the fame, Jim Carrey had visions of himself being very successful in the entertainment industry. In 1985, he wrote himself a fake check worth $10,000,000 for acting services rendered, and dated it 1995. His vision came true only seven years later, when he received his paycheck for the film Dumb and Dumber. V The success of the film helped him bag the lead role in The Mask. His performance was so well-received that he was awarded the Golden Globe for Best Actor for The Mask. A year later, he went on to star as the infamous villain, the Riddler, in Batman Forever. Other 90s movies he was known for were Liar Liar and The Cable Guy. VI Carrey then moved into a slightly more serious role with The Truman Show. His performance in the drama-comedy surprised audiences and critics alike, who were delighted to see how versatile the actor was. He won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama for his stellar performance. He was, at the time, the highest-paid among all comic actors, with a net worth of $150 million.\\n\\nI Leighton Meester is best known for her portrayal of Blair Waldorf in the teen drama, Gossip Girl. While we all know her as the socialite Upper Eastsider and the reigning Queen B at Constance Billard School for Girls, her real life was far from glamorous. When Leightons mother, Constance, gave birth to her in 1986, she was at the beginning of a ten-year prison sentence for trying to smuggle marijuana into the US. II For the first three months of her life, Meester had to stay in a halfway house with her mother. Meesters grandmother took custody of her until her mom was released after 16 months in prison, as her father struggled with his own legal problems. III It wasnt just her mom and dad who were involved in legal troubles. Her grandfather and aunt were also involved in the drug smuggling, and everyone in the family was eventually caught. Meesters aunt even made it to the FBIs 15 Most Wanted List after escaping prison. She was the first-ever woman to be placed on the list. Meesters brother, Douglas, was also found guilty of sexually assaulting a cadet at Colorados Air Force Academy. IV Meester and her mom lived in Florida for a while, but Meester was determined to make it big in Hollywood. When she was ten, she went to a modeling convention in Georgia, where she was immediately signed by an agent. She and her mom then moved to New York to pursue her dreams. Though she was booking gigs with big brands such as The Limited Too and Bloomingdales, she wasnt making a good enough living. They had to stay in dodgy rental houses in Manhattan for a while before her career finally picked up. V At 14 years of age, Meester was living in an apartment in Hollywood, California with her mom. Even with her modeling gigs, money was hard to come by. She had no other choice but to focus on earning money, and so she struggled to relate to other kids her age. She even decided to skip her prom because she found the tickets to be too expensive. VI Meesters relationship with her mother turned sour from around 2011 onwards. Meester had been giving her mother $7,500 monthly in order to care for her sickly brother, Lex. However, her mom reportedly used the money for cosmetic surgery, so she decided to stop sending her allowance. Her mom threatened to sue her as they supposedly had a verbal agreement that Meester had to pay her $10,000 a month. In a court battle, judges decided in favor of the actress.\\n\\nI She may only be 5 foot 2, but this diminutive girl is packed with talent. Onika Tanya Maraj, more famously known as Nicki Minaj, was born on December 8, 1982 in Trinidad and Tobago. Her family transferred to Queens, New York when she was five. Her dad was a drug addict and even set their house on fire in an attempt to murder his wife, Minajs mom. II Her rough childhood prompted young Onika to create fantasy characters. According to the artist, it was her way of reinventing herself. She came up with alter egos, Cookie, Harajuku Barbie, and finally, Nicki Minaj. She wanted to be an empowered woman because, in her mind, it would inspire her mother to be stronger. III She was only 12 when she wrote her very first rap lyrics. She also studied acting at LaGuardia High School of Music and Art, but it didnt work out for her. She took on several jobs, such as waitressing at Red Lobster. However, she never lasted long in such positions because customers often complained about her rude behavior. IV Minaj was determined to make it big in the music industry. She became a back-up singer for various local rappers. Eventually, she was discovered by Fendi, who saw her MySpace page and loved the artists music. She was then introduced to Lil Wayne, who worked with her to release the mixtape Playtime is Over. In 2009, she became the first-ever female artist on Lil Waynes record label. V Her debut album was released in 2010. Her first two singles Massive Attack and Your Love earned her the Best Hip Hop Female award at the BET Awards. Unsurprisingly, she dedicated her win to Lil Wayne. Her album, The Pink Friday, reached triple platinum. In each of her releases, Minaj introduced the world to her alter egos, Onika, Roman Zolanski, and Nicki Lewinsky. VI In 2012, Minaj became a judge on reality singing competition, American Idol. Her relationship with co-judge, Mariah Carey didnt go very smoothly. The two regularly argued on-air during the audition season. Minaj even walked out after a particularly heated argument with Carey. Carey then claimed that she received threats from Minaj, prompting her to hire extra security.\\n\\nI She may only be 5 foot 2, but this diminutive girl is packed with talent.

And when it was announced that the legends life would be adapted for the big screen, people knew whoever landed the part would have very big shoes to fill. Out of the many possible choices, it fell on actor Rami Malek to step up. And boy did he step up, elevating his stardom to new heights. II Rami Malek was born in L.A., California, and has Egyptian Coptic and Greek-Egyptian blood. His parents are both Egyptian immigrants who left Cairo in the late 70s, bound for the US. Rami values his Egyptian heritage a lot. In fact, its actually influenced his choice of roles over the course of his career; all of which started with a formal theater degree from the University of Evansville. III The public got a glimpse of Ramis acting chops when he appeared in the Night at the Museum movies alongside Hollywood heavyweight Ben Stiller, as well as in the Twilight Saga movies. His unique appearance, specifically his eyes, made a mark on fans, and according to Rami himself, would play a big factor in him landing the role of Freddie Mercury later on. IV However, it wasnt all sunshine and rainbows. Early in his career, Rami took small roles, and on more than one occasion, his scenes were cut from the final release of the movies. His roles as Clark in the drama The Master as well as Browning in the movie Oldboy, released in 2012 and 2013 respectively, were also cut down quite significantly. V Fortunately, Ramis work ethic was forged by a history of working his way through odd jobs as he made a name for himself in Hollywood. He took work bussing and waiting tables, delivering pizza, and even serving in a shawarma and falafel shop, all to make ends meet. So, while his roles were cut down, he was more than happy to keep on working. VI And when he finally landed the lead in a TV show called Mr. Robot, Rami skyrocketed to the Hollywood A-list, winning the 2016 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, the first Egyptian-American actor to win an Emmy award for acting, and the first non-white actor to win the award in 18 years.\\n\\nI Hollywood has no shortage of beautiful actresses. But in recent years, especially due to a big hit franchise called the Marvel Cinematic Universe, actress Scarlett Johansson has taken center stage. Her role as superhero Black Widow catapulted her to fame with comic book fans and movie fans alike, standing side-by-side with her male counterparts as the only female in the original Avengers lineup. II Scarlett, who has Swedish and Jewish ancestry, was born in Manhattan, New York, on November 22, 1984. She seemed destined for Hollywood, or at least the arts industry, being a member of a family working in film. Her grandfather was a screenwriter and director, and her mother was a producer. III Johansson started out early, teaching herself to cry on command in front of a mirror as a child. She and her twin brother Hunter started auditioning when they were just seven years old. She even had to see her twin get signed to a talent agency that rejected her. Despite this, she soldiered on, and eventually debuted in her first movie, North in 1994. IV From then on, she landed parts in The Horse Whisperer alongside Hollywood icon Robert Redford, as well as more mature roles like 2003 film Lost in Translation along with Bill Murray. Lost in Translation won her a BAFTA for Best Actress, and set her on a path towards more high profile roles, alongside an ever-growing list of A-list co-stars. V But shes not just an actress. Not many people know that Scarlett is also a singer. People got a glimpse of her singing chops in Lost in Translations karaoke scene, but thats just the tip of the iceberg. She sang an Oscar-nominated Best Original Song in 2013 for the movie Chasing Ice titled Before My Time. She also released two albums, one in 2008 and the other in 2009. VI Considering that she has been smoking since she was 15, and is only 53 tall, Scarlett packs quite a punch in the music industry. But she packs an even stronger wallop as Black Widow in the Avengers series. This role was actually meant for Emily Blunt who had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. Scarlett took ownership of the role to the extent that no-one could imagine anyone but her embodying Black Widow. And she is set to have her own movie very soon.\\n\\nI When it comes to superheroes, you cant get any more American than Captain America himself. So, when it came time to cast the actor who would play the Captain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the fit had to be perfect. Fortunately, the role went to actor Chris Evans, who not only matches the appearance to a T but also has the acting chops to back it up. II Born in Boston, Massachusetts on June 13, 1981, Chris Evans almost never took the role of Captain America. In fact, he wasnt a comic book fan in his youth. Not only that, Chris was afraid that the role would severely affect his much-valued private life, which is why he turned it down when it was first offered to him. It took a chat with co-star Robert Downey Jr. for Chris to change his mind. III Chris acting journey started in his junior year of high school. Lisa, his mom, is the artistic director of the Concord Youth Theater, where Chris started honing his craft from a young age. One of his first performances was in a two-man play called Fallen Star. IV As it turns out, looking and acting like a super-soldier isnt the only talent Chris has. As a hobby, Chris does tap dance, a skill he learned from his mom who was also a professional dancer. There was actually a tap dance floor in the basement of the house Chris grew up in, and he claims that tap dance is what helps him calm his anxiety. V In fact, Chris isnt a stranger to these things. Whereas most action stars would try to live up to or endure the reputation of a macho hunk, Chris is quite introspective and in-touch with his mental and emotional well-being. In fact, he stated that he checked himself into therapy to work on his head before signing on for Captain America: The First Avenger. VI Chris is a hero in more ways than one. Not only is he notoriously humble according to many fans, but he is also very much involved in charity work. Chris is an avid supporter of Breast Cancer Care and works to make a difference in the lives of breast cancer patients. Hes also active with Got Your 6, whose main goal is to change the way America treats military veterans and their families.\\n\\nI When it comes to entertainment, whether it is sports, movies, or TV shows, there arent many who can have cross-platform appeal on all fronts. Among those special few, one name stands out above the rest; a man who started out as the most electrifying man in sports entertainment who is now one of Hollywoods most bankable stars Dwayne The Rock Johnson. II The Rock is virtually a household name now. But his rise to superstardom did not come easy, even though his family was already wrestling royalty by the time he was born. Both his grandfather, Peter Maivia, and his father, Rocky Johnson, were wrestling superstars, and his grandmother, Lia Maivia, was a pioneer, one of the first female wrestling promoters. III Nevertheless, Dwayne grew up with uncertainty. He was an awkward teenager and even got arrested more than a few times thanks to his thieving activities as part of a gang. He was kicked out of home at the age of 14, became a criminal who picked-pocketed tourist, and was largely on a path to ruin. That is until he turned it all around and focused on football. IV The Rocks career wasnt destined to be in that sport, however, and soon he was making his debut in WWE. While he was disliked and booed at first, he transformed his character, and with his amazing athleticism, unparalleled charisma, and witty catchphrases, he rapidly rose through the ranks. One of his catchphrases actually ended up in the dictionary, with the word smackdown being attributed to him. V So, it was inevitable that he would one day set his sights on Hollywood. While many people think of The Scorpion King as his first breakout role (for which he holds a record for the highest-paid first-time lead actor), Dwayne actually appeared on-screen earlier than this. In fact, his first TV role was playing his real-life father in an episode of That 70s Show. VI Since then, Dwaynes star has been steadily skyrocketing with no signs of slowing down. From starring in multiple Fast and Furious franchise sequels to being an internet icon known for his Instagram posts and epic cheat meals, Dwayne has recently added championing mental health to his list, being an advocate for men to reach out and deal with their depression and anxiety. Indeed, The Rock has openly admitted to suffering from these problems himself.\\n\\nI There is a saying, nice guys finish last. If that is true, then superstar Chris Pratt would have been long gone by now. And yet, after a successful series of movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe playing comic-book superhero Peter Quill, aka Star Lord, Chris career seems to have taken an upswing to new heights. II Chris Pratt started out with very little to his name, and with no clothes on his body, figuratively and literally! Early in his life, he was living out of a van in Hawaii after dropping out of community college and becoming a stripper. He admits to not being good at it, however, earning only $40 whenever he performed and even bombing an audition. III He waited tables at a Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant in Maui, Hawaii. While on shift, one of the daughters of actor, director, writer, and musician Tommy Chong, discovered him. Not long after that, Chris landed a part in WBs series Everwood, playing a character named Bright Abbott. In the 15 year reunion of the cast, Chris co-stars shared their belief that he was destined to be a star. IV From then on, he starred in many movies in supporting roles, like Wanted, Jennifers Body, Moneyball, Zero Dark Thirty, Her, and a few others. He also famously played character Andy Dwyer in the hit comedy Parks and Recreation, a character that was supposed to be temporary but was turned into a regular one due to Pratts likable portrayal. V But his A-list status was truly cemented in after he took the lead roles in two highly successful blockbusters in 2014: The Lego Movie, and Guardians of the Galaxy. After those two films, his wholesome appeal spread all over the globe, and one year later, he was named by Time magazine as one of its 100 most influential people in the world. VI Despite some criticism for his beliefs, particularly his openness for his faith and religious convictions he made his now-famous/infamous nine rules acceptance speech at the 2018 MTV Movie and TV Awards that drew both praise and criticism from people Chris Pratts star continues to shine. Indeed, he now has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\\n\\nI Halle Berry is a highly-acclaimed actress who is best known for her incredible performance in the film, Monsters Ball. Born on August 14, 1966, in Cleveland Ohio, Halle Maria Berry was the youngest child of Jerom and Judith Berry, an interracial couple. Her childhood was mostly spent with her older sister, Heidi. Her father abandoned the family in the early 70s, which prompted them to move to a predominantly white Bedford suburb. II While attending an almost all-white school, Berry was subjected to racism and bullying. Rather than being beaten down by the horrific experiences, she channelled them into inspiration to excel at everything she did. Young Halle was very active in extracurricular activities and became the class president, student paper editor, and head cheerleader. She also joined numerous beauty pageants and won quite a few. She earned the Miss Teen Ohio and Miss Teen America titles in the 1980s and won first runner-up in the 1985 Miss USA. III Berry took up Broadcast Journalism at the Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland. However, she decided to shift her career to modeling instead. She quit school and transferred to Chicago first, and then to New York City, where she became a catalog model. IV A few years later, Berry found her way into acting. Her earliest gigs included Knots Landing and Living Dolls. In 1991, she played a stripper in the Bruce Willis film, The Last Boy Scout. The following year, she starred in the comedy film, Boomerang, alongside Eddie Murphy. V In 2001, Berry was praised for her performance in the 2001 drama, Monsters Ball. Her portrayal of the wife of a prisoner from death row who falls in love with a prison guard earned her the Golden Globe and Academy awards for best actress, making her the first female African-American to win an Oscar. At the peak of her film career, her net worth was estimated at $14 million per movie. VI While Berry was at the height of her acting career, her personal life took a turn for the worse. Her marriage to R&B singer Eric Benet came to an end because of infidelity. Only a few days after winning her Oscar for Monsters Ball, news broke of Eric Benets extramarital affair with a former partner. Benet eventually revealed that he was having affairs with several other women. While the two tried to make their marriage work, with Benet undergoing rehab for sex addiction, Berry filed for divorce after two years.\\n\\nI Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson better known as Katy Perry was born in Santa Barbara, California in 1984. She was brought up as a conservative born-again Christian who first tried to make her way into the music industry by releasing a gospel album. However, in 2008, she changed her image completely, and released her hit single, I Kissed a Girl, from the album, One of the Boys. Her second single from the album, Hot n Cold, helped her career take off as well. The album shortly after made it to the Billboard Top 10. II Katys parents were both pastors, and they prohibited her from listening to pop and rock music. She was only allowed to listen to the soundtracks of Sister Act 1 and 2. The Perry children were also banned from watching cable channels, including VH1 and MTV. By age nine, Perry had started taking singing lessons. By 13, she had learned how to play the guitar. In a rebellious move against her strict parents, she had her nose pierced. III When she released her gospel album in 2001, she used the name Katy Hudson. She sold perhaps 100 copies. Eventually, the record label went bankrupt. As a teenager, she started learning about more and more musical genres and got really hooked on the music of Queen. She was fascinated by how theatrical and flamboyant Freddie Mercury, the bands lead singer, was. IV When Perry was 17, she got her GED and immediately moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music career. She worked with Glen Ballard, a producer and songwriter who has previously partnered with Alanis Morisette and Christina Aguillera. Life was hard for Perry in the early years of her career. At one point, she had to sell her clothes just so she could pay rent. V Katy faced a series of rejections before finally signing with Capitol Records in 2007, and the rest is history. She became known for her colorful, over-the-top performances, and to this day, her concerts are always sold out. Katy released hit after hit and has now earned a slew of awards. VI In 2009, Perry started a relationship with British comedian Russel Brand. They married a year later in a lavish ceremony in India. The wedding featured a parade of elephants, horses, camels, snake charmers, jugglers, and dancers. Sadly, it wasnt to last. Their marriage was over by December of 2011. According to Perry, Brand informed her of the separation via a text.\\n\\nI Stephen Edwin King was only two years old when his father left him, his mother, and his older brother, David. His mom had to raise the two children by herself. The family lived originally in Portland, Maine, but because of the abandonment and financial struggles, they moved from state to state quite frequently. King was brought up as a Methodist, but he stopped believing in religion when he reached high school. While hes not religious, he says hes not an atheist and does believe that God exists. II As a young boy, King saw one of his best friends die after being hit by a train. According to his family, upon returning from an afternoon of play, King was in a state of complete shock. However, King has no recollection of the traumatic incident. More than one person has made the link between this event and the dark stories King has spent his career writing; The Body having the most clear and direct connection. III King is a graduate of the University of Maine. While writing his first novel, he worked as a teacher. He published his very first horror novel, Carrie, under the pen name, Richard Bachman. The book was a huge hit and significantly contributed to the success of his writing career. He went on to sell over 350 million copies of Carrie. His novel was so epic that it was even adapted into a film. IV Because of the huge success of Carrie, King had the luxury of being able to write full time. He went on to release more and more horror novels, including The Shining, It, Firestarter, Salems Lot, and Cujo. In 2015, King was given the National Medal of Arts for his significant contribution to literature. V At the height of Kings career, he was able to write his novels at amazing speed. During the 80s and 90s, he published numerous books each year. His novels are still regularly adapted into award-winning films and miniseries. In the film adaptation of Misery, actress Kathy Bates received an Oscar for her portrayal of Annie Wilkes. VI On January 2, 1971, King married novelist and activist, Tabitha Spruce. The two have three houses: two in Maine, and one in Florida. They have three children, two of whom are also writers. In the early 70s, King became addicted to alcohol. When his mother died of uterine cancer, King delivered the eulogy while intoxicated. Apparently, his addiction got so bad that he doesnt even remember writing Cujo. His family and friends eventually performed an intervention which prompted him to seek help and quit.\\n\\nI Stephen William Hawking is arguably the best theoretical physicist of all time. He was born on January 8, 1942, in England. Interestingly, his date of birth is exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo Galilei. Despite his fathers desire for him to take up medicine, Hawking studied physics at Oxford. He then studied cosmology (the study of the universe) at Cambridge. II During his time at Cambridge, Hawking became a research fellow and then a professional fellow. He became a member of the Royal Society, a worldwide community of scientists, in 1974. He then became Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, the highest academic chair in history, in 1979. III A few days before turning 21, Hawking found out that he had a motor neuron condition called Lou Gehrigs disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He was told he only had two more years to live. However, as we know it, he beat the odds and contributed a lot to the study of cosmology. As the disease worsened, Hawking eventually needed a wheelchair. IV In 1985, he had to undergo a tracheotomy, which caused him to lose his voice. To allow him to communicate, a speech device and accompanying software program were created for him at Cambridge. This served as Hawkings voice. To make it work, Hawking only needed to move his cheek muscles. V Hawkings career focused on studying the universe and the laws governing it. He theorized that since the world had a beginning (the Big Bang), it only makes sense that it will have an ending as well. He suggested that space and time emerged when the universe was born and that everything will eventually come to an end in a black hole. VI Apart from being a brilliant scientist, Hawking was a great writer as well. His first book was called A Brief History of Time. In it, Hawking tried to explain his theories on the beginning and possible end of the world in laymans terms. It became a bestseller shortly after it was published.\\n\\nI Shania Twain is a Canadian country singer who rose to fame in the early 90s. She was born Eilleen Regina Edwards on August 28, 1965 in Ontario, Canada. At a young age, she had to witness her parents rough divorce. Her mother, Sharon, remarried to an Ojibwa name Jerry Twain. When they wed, he adopted all of Sharons daughters, thus, Eilleens last name was changed from Edwards to Twain. II Eilleen spent her childhood in Timmins, Ontario. Her family was financially challenged, to the point that they sometimes had nothing to eat but bread with mayonnaise. Sharons second husband also tended to be violent, physically abusing his wife. However, young Shanias dark days were brightened by her love for music. III When she was 18, Twain decided to seriously pursue a career in music. While she did find work, it was difficult to make ends meet. She took on several other jobs while singing, including waitressing at McDonalds. In 1987, her mother and stepfather died in a car accident. Being the eldest, the responsibility of supporting her three siblings fell on her. IV While times were tough, she never stopped writing her own music. Shania submitted demos everywhere, and she was eventually discovered and signed by Polygram Records (later renamed Mercury Nashville). Her label wasnt a huge fan of her name (which was still Eilleen at the time), so she decided to change her first name to Shania, which means Im on my way in Ojibwe. V Her first album, Shania Twain, did not make it big in the music scene. But it did grab the attention of producer Robert John Mutt Lange, who offered to work with Twain on another album. Her second album, The Woman in Me, was released in 1995. VI At the time, her personal life wasnt so bad either. She married her partner, Robert JohnLange, six months after they met. They lived in Switzerland to avoid the public eye. She gave birth to her first son, Eja DAngelo Lange, in 2001. In 2008, seven years after their wedding, the two separated after Twain learned that Lange had an affair with another woman.\\n\\nI Quite a few English actors have made their mark on Hollywood over the years. But these days, at the very peak of the Hollywood mountain where the A-listers reside, one English actor stands out: Benedict Cumberbatch, a man whose acting portfolio is as amazing and varied as it can get. II Benedict Cumberbatch, whose latest major undertaking is Marvel comic-book superhero Dr. Stephen Strange, is one of the most sought after actors in Hollywood today. This is just the latest in a string of fictional superhero (and villain) roles that include Sherlock Holmes, Smaug from The Hobbit, and Khan Noonien Singh in Star Trek: Into Darkness. III But Benedict is anything but a one-dimensional actor. In fact, he is a literal master of his craft, with a masters degree in classical acting for the professional theatre, which he achieved in the highly prestigious London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. IV One of Benedicts signature features, which he has used to great effect in many of his roles, is his eyes. He has a condition called central heterochromia, which is not a health risk, but which has caused his eyes to have multiple colors. Benedicts eyes have shades of green, blue, and even gold. Its no wonder fans melt when he turns his gaze on them! V The ways in which Benedict lands and prepares for his roles is quite interesting. For example, once he landed the role of Sherlock Holmes in the series Sherlock, he read all of Arthur Conan Doyles works to bring the performance to life the right way. And then, for the role of Khan Noonien Singh in Star Trek: Into Darkness, he filmed his audition using an iPhone in his friends kitchen. VI In an interesting twist, Benedicts personal life is full of stories that would rival his fictional characters experiences. He taught English in a Tibetan monastery for his gap year, learned to play the violin in the span of one week, and in South Africa, he was held at gunpoint, kidnapped, thrown in the trunk of a car, and then released in the middle of nowhere.\\n\\nI Tom Holland is one of the most well-known and loved young actors in Hollywood today. Having played the wildly popular comic-book superhero Spider-Man in five separate films (including two outings as the star of a couple of massively successful Spider-Man movies), Tom Holland continues to charm audiences today, both on and off-screen. II Tom started his career very early in his life. In fact, he landed a role in a prestigious West End (Londons Broadway) musical, Billy Elliot the Musical. And while it took him eight auditions and two years of training to be cast as the supporting character, Michael, it only took him a couple of months of performing to take over the lead role. III But his acting chops come from more than just passion and raw talent. Tom attended the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology, a school that produced quite a number of high-profile stars and talents, including Amy Winehouse, Jessie J, and Adele. IV His meteoric rise to Hollywood A-list status, however, came from him playing the role of Spider-Man back in 2016. At just 19 years of age, Tom was the youngest actor to ever play the part. His predecessors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were 27 and 26 years old respectively during their runs as the friendly neighborhood web-slinger. V Tom took to the role like a duck to water. He underwent intensive education in gymnastics, boxing, circuit training, and more. Not only that, he stuck to a strict diet regimen to give him the strength, speed, skills, and physique to play the superhero. His efforts paid off, so much so that Tom was allowed by the director to do as many stunts as he wanted himself. VI But his heroism didnt stop on-screen. Despite having some mishaps and being known as a spoiler source when he does interviews, Tom has taken his role to the next level, saying that the best part of being Spider-Man is frequently visiting children in hospitals and bringing them joy and smiles. Not only that, Tom also leapt to the aid of Zendaya when the latter was attacked online.\\n\\nI African-American superhero roles on-screen have, for the most part, been few and far between. And while Wesley Snipes opened the door when he played the vampire-hunter Blade, it would be many years before the next major blockbuster would happen. That moment came when the Marvel Cinematic Universe showcased the superhero Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman. II Chadwick Boseman was born on November 29, 1977, son of a nurse and a textile factory worker in Anderson, South Carolina. Growing up, he wanted to write and direct, having written his first play, Crossroads, back in junior high school. He staged the play in school after a fellow classmate was shot and killed. III Boseman took his passion and dream very seriously, and pursued it at Howard University in Washington DC, achieving a bachelors degree in fine arts and directing. Next, his teacher mentor, Phylicia Rashad, helped raise the money needed for Chadwick and a few classmates to go to the British American Drama Academy in London where they joined the Oxford Mid-Summer Program. IV Once he arrived home to the US, he went straight to work, becoming the drama instructor of the Schomburg Junior Scholars Program in Brooklyn, and appearing in a number of television roles, including Third Watch, CSI: New York, Law & Order, E.R, Lincoln Heights, and Persons Unknown. During this period, he also got his first feature film role in the movie, The Express. V But after many other movie roles, Chadwicks higher calling was to play TChalla, aka, Black Panther. In fact, he stated that he actually prayed to be cast as the titular character. He might not have needed the supernatural assistance, however, as he didnt even need to audition to get the part. VI Chadwick took the role seriously, training in a variety of different martial arts to develop the body and skills needed to portray the Wakandan king. Not only that, but he also studied the behavior and mannerisms of leaders and warriors of African descent and ancestry, even insisting on speaking with an African accent. The end result was a performance that made waves not only in Hollywood, but all over the world.\\n\\nI When one hears the words comic-book superhero, images of superpowers, mutants, and advanced technology come to mind. This is why playing Hawkeye (a mere human amongst super-soldiers, hulks, and literal gods) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies required an actor who can portray a man that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with these behemoths. And Jeremy Renner fit the bill perfectly. II Californian Jeremy Renner, born on January 6, 1971, started getting into acting when he took a drama class as an elective while studying computer science and criminology in Modesto Junior College. Fast-forward a few years to 1995, and he landed a role in what has now become a cult favorite, National Lampoons Senior Trip. III While the movie was initially panned by critics and fans alike, it opened the door for Renner to get into other acting roles. He continued working on television shows like Deadly Games, Strange Luck, Angel, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. But despite all these, it was difficult to make ends meet, so he also worked as a makeup artist in between acting jobs. IV But things started to turn for the better when, in 2002, Jeremy played the serial-killer Jeffrey Dahmer in the movie Dahmer. While the role became a burden for him after filming, leaving him struggling to cope with the headspace he had to get into for it, his performance was praised, and he was nominated for the Best Lead Male award at the Independent Spirit Awards. V From then on, he starred in many hit movies, like S.W.A.T, alongside Colin Farrell and LL Cool J, A Little Trip to Heaven with Forest Whitaker, and eventually, critically acclaimed movies The Hurt Locker, and The Town, which garnered him numerous nominations at the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. VI Many of these movies gave him the skills he needed to embody Hawkeye in The Avengers. Along with his training in Filipino Martial Arts, Muay Thai, archery, and more, this experience made his performance as the special agent an iconic one. And it wont be the last time he brings us epic action on-screen.\\n\\nI Many wrestlers from the sports-entertainment world have successfully made the jump from the ring to the big screen, including legends like Hulk Hogan, Dwayne The Rock Johnson, and John Cena. The latest in this list is Dave Bautista, whose movie journey has seen him take on various roles until he finally landed the part of the loveable Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy. II David Michael Bautista was born on January 18, 1969, and almost immediately found himself on a path of struggle, hardship, and determination. Before he was nine years old, three murders had already occurred on his front lawn. At 17, he was estranged from his parents and living on his own. However, he would later credit them as the people who taught him the value of hard work. III And work hard he did. He became a nightclub bouncer, a role which led to a fight that got him a year on probation. Then he worked as a lifeguard, and eventually as a bodybuilder, which Bautista says is what saved his life. IV Bautista made his wrestling debut in 2002, marking the start of a wrestling career that would span nearly fifteen years. During this time, he had an amazing series of achievements, from having the longest reign as World Heavyweight Champion to being part of one of the most successful stables in wrestling history Evolution. V It was during the periods in between wrestling that Bautista began acting. Bautista got his start in movies like 2010s Wrong Side of Town, 2012s The Man with the Iron Fists, 2013s Riddick, and so on. But what could be considered his breakout mainstream role was playing Drax the Destroyer in the Marvel Cinematic Universes Guardians of the Galaxy. VI In this role, Bautista displayed a talent that few people realized he was capable of comedy. His portrayal of Drax, who cannot understand metaphors and so takes everything literally, was so loveable to audiences that it won him a new legion of fans, many of whom had no idea about his menacing wrestling characters.\\n\\nI Channing Matthew Tatum was born on April 26, 1980, in Cullman, Alabama, to Glenn and Kay Tatum. He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and dyslexia at a young age. His conditions made it difficult for him to learn in school, and so he was primarily focused on sports such as track, baseball, football, and soccer. II Tatum was granted a football scholarship at Glenville State College, West Virginia. However, he dropped out of school after a while to make a living. He started working as a roofer, and then quit to become a stripper under the screen name, Chan Crawford. When he made it big in Hollywood, he was adamant about producing a film about his life as a stripper; hence, Magic Mike. III Long before his Magic Mike fame, Tatum transferred to Miami, Florida. He signed with a modeling agency that discovered him on a Miami street. He modeled for various brands including Gap, Nautica, Abercrombie & Fitch, and American Eagle Outfitters. IV Tatums modeling career eventually led him into acting. In 2004, he was given a bit role on CSI: Miami. Soon after, he was cast opposite Samuel L. Jackson in the film, Coach Carter. Later that year, he was given small roles in other films such as Supercross, War of the Worlds, and Havoc. In 2006, he landed the lead role in two films, Shes the Man and Step Up. V By 2009, Tatum had already established himself as an action star. To switch things up a little, he appeared in the romantic drama films, Dear John and The Vow. He tried his hand at comedy as well, starring in Haywire and 21 Jump Street. Appearing in such films proved his versatility as an actor. VI When Tatum was filming Step Up, he fell in love with co-star, Jenna Dewan. In 2009, the couple married, and in 2013, bore a daughter whom they named Everly. After nine years as a married couple, the two decided to split amicably, releasing a joint statement about their separation. While the two are no longer together, they remain on good terms, valuing the needs of their daughter above all else.\\n\\nI Steve Jobs was a successful businessman, most well-known for being the CEO of Apple, responsible for launching the iPad, iPhone, and MacBook. Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco; and died of pancreatic cancer in 2011. His parents, John Jandali and Joanne Schieble were both university students when they had him. As the couple had not been married, they gave up young Steve for adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs took him in and treated him as their own. II Paul Jobs encouraged his son to conduct electronic experiments in their garage; as such, Steve grew up surrounded by electronics. He went to Reed College in Portland, Oregon, where he excelled academically. He also enjoyed calligraphy, which is why Apple has such a stylish design. However, his teachers complained about his stubbornness. III Jobs went to India in 1974 in order to find spiritual enlightenment. He spent many months there with his good friend, Daniel Kottke. Together, they learned about Buddhism and Eastern philosophy. He tried his fair share of psychedelic drugs as well. Jobs later shared how his escapades in India played a crucial role in giving him a better perspective on life. IV After returning from India, Jobs worked for Atari computers where he met Steve Wozniak, a computer technician whom he admired. Wozniak, Jobs, and Ronald Wayne soon joined forces to establish Apple computers, selling the first units from the Jobs garage. V In spite of the success of the company, Jobs had conflicting ideas with other Apple employees. This prompted him to resign from his post in 1985. According to him, that experience allowed him to have a sense of freedom and innovation once again. He then started his own company called NeXT computers. It didnt do so well and ended up being bought by Apple in 1996. Hence, Jobs was back with Apple once again. VI Following Jobs return to Apple, he developed the iPhone and introduced the touchscreen and multi-functional smartphone in 2007. By 2010, he released the iPad, a tablet version of the mobile phone. His philosophy in creating the products was to build an innovative device that people would get excited by.\\n\\nI On February 17, 1963, James and Deloris Jordan welcomed their fourth child, Michael Jordan, into the world.

He continued to contribute to his teams success during his sophomore and junior years. However, he dropped out after his third year and got picked by the Chicago Bulls in the 1984 NBA draft. III At the time that he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls, the team wasnt doing well, and only had about 6,000 fans watch home games. When Jordan joined the team, everything changed. Fans were in awe of his fierceness and competitiveness. IV Jordans father was brutally murdered in 1993 in a robbery attempt. Full of grief for his dads passing, and with rumors of a gambling addiction circling round him, Jordan decided to retire. In the nine seasons that he played for the Chicago Bulls, he won three MVP awards, three NBA titles, three playoff MVP titles, and seven scoring titles. He was also the teams all-time best scorer. V Following his loss, Jordans game suffered. During the 1994 season, the Bulls lost to the Orlando Magic in the playoffs. Jordan was determined to prove to everybody that he still had it in him, and his commitment led the Bulls to a record-breaking 72-10 victory in 1995. They won the championship once again in 1996, and the audience watched as Jordan fell to his knees the final game was held on Fathers Day, three years after his dads death. VI In 1999, Jordan retired a second time around. He went on to become the president and part-owner of the Washington Wizards. Three years later, Jordan went back to play for the Wizards.

III Stallone became homeless during the 70s, yet he was determined to pursue his passion for scriptwriting. Things got so bad that he had to sell his most beloved pet and only remaining possession Butkus, his bull mastiff. IV With the money he earned from selling his precious dog, Stallone had the chance to continue writing his script for Rocky. When he presented his script to production houses, at least two gave him exciting offers. However, he turned down both because the producers didnt want him to play the lead character. After intense negotiations, the producers eventually conceded to his demand. V When Stallone finally got a company to produce his film under his terms, he was intent on getting his dog, Butkus, back. However, the guy he sold his pup too wasnt keen on relinquishing the dog. After several arguments and threats from Stallones end, the new owner returned Butkus to Stallone. Butkus then went on to make an appearance in Rocky. VI In 1974, Stallone got married to Sasha Czack. The two had two sons together but divorced ten years later.

At a very early age, she showed great interest in singing, prompting her mom to bring her to Atlanta to audition for The Mickey Mouse Club. Britney didnt make the cut as she was way too young, but she did meet a talent agent who enrolled her in the Professional Performing Arts School. II Spears auditioned a second time for The Mickey Mouse Club in 1992, and finally got picked. Her co-stars at the time included Ryan Gosling, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake. When the show got canceled two years later, Spears went back home to Kentwood, Louisiana. In 1997, Spears partnered with producer Eric Foster, who taught her how to sing specifically for pop music.

I did it Again. She went on to release a third and self-titled album in 2001, which also topped the charts. IV Britney Spears tried her hand at acting in 2002, appearing in the film Crossroads. While the movie didnt do that well, her performance was nevertheless lauded by critics.

III The six stars found in the Subaru logo serve as a reference to Pleiades. The Pleiades is a cluster of stars in the constellation Taurus. The Japanese name for Taurus is Subaru. IV The name Volvo in Latin means “I roll”. The Volvo logo symbol is a circle that consists of an arrow pointing out. This is an ancient chemical symbol which represents iron. The logo is also recognized as the oldest ideogram in the Western culture. V 50 years ago, when Volvo invented the modern three-point seat-belt, the company made the patent free and open to all other car manufacturers. The seat belt has saved millions of people from accidents. They save up to 12,000 lives every year, in the United States alone.

Most times, a mother holds her pup by the hand so that they do not separate from each other and go missing. Other sea otters also practice this technique to make sure no one drifts away. II Bob Dylan suddenly decided to change his name when he started acting, just because he felt the name sounded better. However, his birth name is Robert Allen Zimmerman. III A crocodile has a very big tongue, but unlike normal mammals, it is attached to the roof of its mouth. Hence, the crocodile’s tongue is immobile, which means the crocodile cannot stick its tongue out.\\n\\nI It was during the World War II, when people were going out of food, and chocolate rations were getting really small, that Nutella was invented. They added hazelnuts to chocolate to make the now famous Nutella. II The name of the Twitter Bird is Larry, after the famous basketball player’s name, Larry Bird.

He started his music career while living with her and recorded ‘Goodbye My Lover’ in her bathroom. He went on to record his whole album there. II In order to save the seals of the Antarctica from diseases spread by dogs, the government banned all visitors and travelers from bringing dogs to the continent. This was declared since 1994.

V In 1995, “Toy Story” became the first feature film to be created strictly by Computer Generated Imagery. More than 800,000 hours of mathematical equations went down in order to achieve it. This means more than one week of computer time for every second on the screen. VI The sole character that has been used over time to depict horror in movies, is Count Dracula.

Mary made $10,000 in one single week, during the peak of her popularity. III “The Birds”, written by Hitchcock in 1963, had trained birds thrown at actress Tippi Hedren. As part of the sequence, some of the birds were tied to her with nylon threads, in order to prevent them from flying away from the scene. It made shooting stop every few minutes, so that blood could be painted on her skin, and her costume could be torn. IV The laser swords which were used in the “Star Wars” movie, in 1977, were actually fiberglass rods that were coated with a high-quality reflective material. The light reflection on the rods, caused by mirrors in front of the camera lens, were later enhanced through animation. V Actress Linda Blair, wo played the role of Regan in ‘The Exorcist’, almost turned her head completely around to face backward.

It was also the first 128-bit console ever made. It was released to the market and like other Sega products, it was sold out in no time. III Domains are being bought by the day, and almost all simple domain names are gone.

These domains may not lead anywhere, but apparently their new owners feel safe knowing they’re not available to anyone else.\\n\\nI In 2009, a female from the sixteenth century had her skull with a rock wedged to it, near the remains of a plague victim. In that century, it was rather unusual to put a rock and a brick in the mouth of a vampire in order to prevent them from feeding on the bodies of other plague casualties, and stop them from attacking those who were alive. The bubonic plague throughout Europe was made popular by female vampires. II If a person was bitten by a vampire, according to the legends, it is regarded that he or she is advised to drink the ash of a burned vampire. When someone wants to prevent an attack, a person should make bread with the blood of vampires. III Hollywood and literary vampires typically left the norm, deviating from folklore vampires. As an example, Hollywood vampires are typically pale, aristocratic, and very old, they need their native soil, and are usually supernaturally beautiful, and need to be bitten to become a vampire. In contrast, folklore vampires before Bram Stoker are usually peasants, recently dead, appear as shapeless “bags of blood,” do not need their native soil, and are often cremated with or without being hanged. IV Symbolic value held significant historical thresholds, and a vampire cannot cross the thresholds unless they are invited. There is a connection between the old and new vampires, it seems to be the concept of either complicity or allowance. Once there is a covenant for evil, it can resurface anytime. V Methods of repelling vampires before the advent of Christianity, included garlic, hawthorn branch, sprinkling of seeds, fire, decapitation with a gravedigger\\'s spade, salt, iron, bells, a rooster crow, peppermint, running water, and burying people face down so that they would dig the wrong way and get lost in the earth. VI These methods introduced by Christianity to ward off vampires started with the use of holy water, crucifixes, and Eucharist wafers. The methods usually had little effect on vampires.\\n\\nI The modern form of vaccination was first developed in 1796 by Edward Jenner. Edward successfully used a weaker form of the disease (cowpox) to inoculate children. All potential recruits for the revolutionary army were ordered by George Washington to get smallpox inoculations. II Some parents decide not to vaccinate their children because they believe the vaccines can cause autism. A lot of anti-vaccination companies continue to act against this claim even though this claim has been proven false. III Vaccines are older than anesthesia and antibiotics. Vaccines remains one of the oldest medical treatments known. The first modern vaccination method was inspired after the global Smallpox outbreak, a deadly disease . IV Smallpox killed more than two million people globally in 1967. This situation sped up the production of vaccinations to eradicate the disease. Vaccinations have prevented several cases of smallpox and now there are only a few cases every year. V Puritan preacher Cotton Mather urged his fellow citizen to obtain inoculations after an outbreak of smallpox in colonial Boston. Cotton Mather’s effort helped contain the spread of the smallpox. VI United Kingdom was the first to pass laws pertaining to vaccination. United Kingdom passed the first act in 1840 and this helped provide vaccinations needed for smallpox to the poor. In 1853, United Kingdom passed another law making sure every child was vaccinated. Failure to follow this law can result to jail or being fined.\\n\\nI A monkey named Naruto got the popular wildlife photographer, David Slater, into a court case with the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, as the monkey took a selfie of himself with Slater’s camera. II In 1820, the last known part of the Earth was discovered by a Russian expedition, the Antarctica. However, the Russians only spotted the ice shelves and never landed on the site. It was not until 75 years later that the Norwegians made the record.\\n\\nI Another unintended use for Google is ‘Random Spell Checker’. This is because a lot of people get confused about the spelling of a word, so they type it on google to see if it’s right. II Yahoo was once the most used search engine, with the largest market share in the late 90s and early 2000s. However, Google came in, snatched the market, and has controlled it ever since. Today, Google records over 35 billion searches daily. III When intelligence worked its way into typing grammar and autocorrect was created, the first error to be auto-corrected was ‘teh’, to ‘the’. At this time, the F3 button was used to send the autocorrected command.\\n\\nI In some cultures, drinking the blood of a victim allowed the drinker to absorb their victim’s strength, take on an animal’s quality, or even make a woman more fecund. The color red is also involved in many vampire rituals. It is a color closely associated to it. II Gandalf the Grey, from the film \"Lord of the Rings\", can also be seen in the collection and retrieval of great wizards that Professor Dumbledore was able to study in “Harry Potter and the Philosopher\\'s Stone”. III J. K. Rowling was named Time Magazine\\'s Person of the Year, in 2007. IV As every Harry Potter fan is aware, Dementors are deadly, magical, wraith-like creatures. Rowling revealed that they represent depression, and that they were based on her own experience with the disease. The remedy to lighten the effects of a Dementor is chocolate. V Dating as far back as 4,000 BC , one of the earliest tale of vampires is found in an an ancient Sumerian and Babylonian myth. It tells about “ekimmu” or “edimmu”, meaning one who is snatched away. The “ekimmu” is a type of “uruku” or “utukku”, which is a spirit demon who they claim was not buried in the right manner, and came back as a vengeful spirit to suck out the life out of living people.\\n\\nI For deaths recorded or acted in a movie, Sean Bean and Bela Lugisi have the highest rates of deaths in movies and TV projects than any other living actor, with 0.32 deaths per film, each. Mickey Rourke and John Hurt are close contenders, with close to 0.31 deaths per film. II The “Sesame Street” movie featured characters like Bert and Ernie, and there was a street named after them. Bert acted as a cop, and his friend Ernie was a taxi driver in Frank Capra\\'s “Its a Wonderful Life” film. III Count von Count from “Sesame Street”, in “The Muppet Vampire”, has a story line based on myths about vampires.

Ubuntu is an African word that means “I am because we are”.\\n\\nI Countess Elizabeth Bathory, one of the most popular “true vampires”, lived between 1560-1614. She was later accused of torturing girls and using their blood to maintain her beauty. II The swimming pool scene used in the opening of the “Sunset Boulevard” movie, in 1950, is the same one used in the 1955 movie, “Rebel Without a Cause”, by James Dean, Sal Mineo and Natalie Wood. III Nearly $4 million dollars were spent in one 10-minute scene in the 1980s movie, “Heaven\\'s Gate”. Not only was it regarded as one of the most notorious flops in history, but also, the abuse of animals during the production made the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers to give power to the American Human Society to be keen on the use of animals in any future films. IV Doris Day, the “Girl Next Door” actress, refused to act in the movie “The Graduate”, in 1939, because of the role of Mrs. Robinson, a middle-aged sexpot with a liking for younger men. V Vivien Leigh, the famous actress in the movie “Gone with the Wind, had many auditions before getting the role. Other famous actresses also read for the part, including Loretta Young, Helen Hayes, Lana Turner, Katherine Hepburn and even Lucille Ball.\\n\\nI Sony once made cameras that could see through people’s clothes. The camera originally had some kind of infrared rays that could aid night vision, but it could also see through clothes, and over 700,000 people bought it. II Kleenex Tissues, which are widely known across the world, were originally intended to be used as replaceable filters in gas masks.

However, the first one to get registered was www.symbolics.com, which was registered on March 15, 1985.\\n\\nI The odds of dying from a vehicle accident in the United States is very high. A lot of people died in the United States after driving at a very high speed. In 1902, the United States started issuing speeding tickets to drivers who drove above 50 mph. II The Toyota Corolla is one of the best-selling cars out there. Toyota sold over 30 million units of this brand since it was produced in 2009. The most expensive car in the world is the Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita. This car costs about $4.8 million. The car is coated with diamonds and there are just three of them in the entire world. III Bertha Benz was the wife of Carl Benz, and she was the first person to drive a car for a long distance. She drove an automobile that was produced by her husband. IV The Jetta, Audi, Bentley, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bugatti and Ducati are all owned by Volkswagen. A lot of Volkswagen’s cars are named after different types of winds. Some examples are Polo, which refer to “polar winds” in German, and Passat, which means “Trade wind” in German. V The heaviest and most expensive speeding fine in the world was $1,000,000. This fine was given to a Swedish man after he was caught going 180 mph in Switzerland. This man was the first to receive such a fine and no one else has been fined such an amount to this day. VI Henry Ford was the first person to manufacture a car that a lot of Americans with an average income could afford. Even though Henry did not invent the modern car, his introduction of the \\'T automobile\\' in 1908, changed the transportation industry in America and the world.\\n\\nI If a polar bear had to eat penguins for a meal, he could eat up to eighty-six of them However, penguins do not live close to Polar bears, or they would have been wiped out. II King Henry VIII of England was a man who loved weapons. He owned thousands of weapons, 6500 of which are different types of handguns. He also slept every night with a giant axe in his bed. III Originally, movie trailers were made to be shown after the movie to remind the audience of the highlights of the movie. This was why it was originally called trailer. When producers noticed that viewers never stayed to view the trailer, they moved it showing to before the movie was out.\\n\\nI According to the bible in Genesis 1:20-22, the chicken existed before the eggs. If you are a Christian, you must have read it once that God created birds. The bible did not say he created eggs, which justifies this fact. II In Japan, ‘Ronald McDonald’ is pronounced ‘Donald McDonald’ because they can’t pronounce the ‘R’. They’ve called him Donald since 1971, when the first McDonalds opened there. III Ever imagined a drunk honeybee? These bees can get drunk from fermented tree saps and cause unwanted accidents!\\n\\nI In 2012 the Los Angeles city council approved a bill called, Meatless Mondays, where plant based meals would be served every Monday. This was part of an international campaign to decrease the rate of the public\\'s meat consumption. II Vegans are very particular with what they consume. For instance, The American Vegan Society do not consider honey do not consume honey as it\\'s an animal byproduct. III More than 90% of the oats grown in United States are eaten by livestock. It was recorded that the number of people who could be fed by the soybeans and grain that are presently fed to the United States livestock is approximated to be above 1,200,000,000. IV The United States has a record of about 12,000 pounds of excrement by its citizens in every seconds. While the overall production of excrement by the United States livestock is 250,000 pounds in every second. This would likely be significantly reduced if humans ate a more plant based diet. V Different researchers argue that the structure of human teeth is similar to any other herbivore in the animal kingdom. For instance, the human molars the shape of human molars, like a horses, or cows molars, are usually blunt and flat, making them good for grinding and not tearing into flesh. VI In 1847, in England, the first Vegetarian Society was formed. This society has just only one objective- to make people understand that it is very possible to be healthy and live a good life without eating meat.\\n\\nI Vaccines are usually available in two main forms. One contains a weaker form of the disease it\\'s vaccinating is known as “live attenuated”, and the other is called “inactivated” , and is made from the virus itself. More places in the world prefer to use the \"dead\" version because the attenuated version requires a cold placed to be stored. II There is a strict guideline that must be kept in order to ensure a vaccine’s safety and purity. This guideline was established by the Food and Drug Administration. All vaccines go through three stages of testing before they are approved for public use. III When testing vaccinations- first human subjects must remain in perfect health, and after this stage, the vaccines will be tested on more varied demographics to be sure that there are no dangerous side effects. IV The widespread of disease can now be prevented with vaccines. The world takes vaccination seriously since nobody wants to spend unnecessary amounts of money on treating diseases that can easily be prevented with a vaccine. V If the majority of the population is vaccinated, the remaining few who don\\'t will be protected. For example, if 80% of a total population have been vaccinated against smallpox, they will prevent the disease from spreading among the remaining 20%. VI All vaccines have different ingredients and these ingredients fit into five main categories. The categories include: the adjuvants that enhances the effectiveness of the antigens, the antigens of the disease itself, preservatives and growth factors that makes the antigens easy to cultivate.\\n\\nI When they first came out, original Xbox sets included exclusive content - like original clips from Nasa’s Apollo missions. II Today, there’s a huge variety of computers from many different brands and with many different specs, but none of them would exist without the first computer ever made.

And then there’s the petabyte, which is made up of 1024 terabytes. A drive that contains up to 1 petabyte can contain up to 13 years of high definition recordings!\\n\\nI A full HD movie can be downloaded in milliseconds at the NASA Building. The Internet speed is about an average of 91GB per second. This is 10,000 times faster than the fastest household connection. II Back in the 1980\\'s, it used to cost $437,500 to own a storage of 1 gigabyte. However, the price began to go down so much, that it was worth only 11 dollars in the year 2000. By 2016, it was already less than two cents.\\n\\nI J.K. Rowling chose the female name ‘Hermione’, to shed a good light on hard working nerdy girls, who are usually teased for being themselves. She had gotten the name from “A Winter’s Tale” by Shakespeare. II When a company wanted to start in 1939, they had a lot of disagreements over what to name the company, so they tossed a coin. This resulted in the name Hewlett Packard, also known as HP. III The Eiffel Tower is 108 stories tall, and it has a total of One Thousand, Six Hundred and Sixty-Five steps on the inside. If the ones that lead from outside the building to the top of the building are counted, it will make a total of 1,710 steps, but no one is allowed to climb those.\\n\\nI The “Food and Drug Administration” and “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention” have both created a database to collect reports about abnormal vaccine reactions. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) collects reports made by private and professional individuals. This report is accessible to everyone. II A California-based company produced a vaccine in 1955, and this vaccine contains a robust strain of the poliovirus. A total of 200,000 people were vaccinated, but 10 of the children died and 192 were paralyzed. III A group of our white blood cells in the immune system can remember the bacteria and viruses they have encountered in the past. Vaccines mimic this process and introduce a similar version of a disease in order to teach your body how to fight the real disease. IV A lot of diseases can be prevented via vaccination and some of them include Hepatitis B, Hib disease, measles, polio, tetanus, smallpox, diphtheria, influenza, rubella, rotavirus and pertussis. All of these diseases can be prevented through proper vaccination. V Vaccination can have a slight side effect after being administered. Some of the side effects include chills, local swelling where the vaccine was administered and slight fever. All of these side effects will only last for a short period.',\n",
              " \"I Getting to see deleted scenes from a well-loved movie is like finding a $20 bill inside your back pocket: an unexpected but lovely surprise. Fortunately for Marvel fans, the home release of Avengers: Endgame includes six deleted scenes. One of them was of the surviving Avengers watching the video clip of the Battle of New York. Rocket mocks the team for taking 2-3 hours to win against the Chitauri, the suckiest army in the galaxy. II Next up, we see Tony and Pepper talking in their kitchen about their goji berries and how Tonys alpaca, Gerald, has eaten all of them. The scene takes place right before Tony goes to the front yard to find his daughter, Morgan. According to writer Christopher Markus, that scene was supposed to be an establishing scene, but they decided to cut it in the end because the story had not gotten to them yet. III The next deleted scene shows Rocket and Thor together in 2013 Asgard. Regrettably for Rocket, he sees the intoxicated Thor pee over the balcony. Rocket proceeds to ask Thor for directions, but Thor is of no help. He then remarks, You dont know? You used to freakin live here! The writers decided to cut it from the film as there were already way too many set-up scenes for Thor and Rocket. IV Next is a scene showing Captain America and War Machine talking about the Tesseract. Rhodes was curious as to why Rogers had to crash the plane that carried the stone. When Rogers explained that there were bombs on board, Rhodes, still puzzled, asked, But why didnt you just jump out before it crashed? Rogers, perhaps realizing Rhodes was right, did not respond. The scene had to be deleted because they simply could not squeeze it into the film. V A very short scene from 1970s New Jersey comes next, with Tony and his dad Howard. Howard offers Tony a job in his company, to which Tony responds, Im a bit tied up in futures, right now. The touching scene between father and son, while very beautiful, had to be deleted due to time limitations. VI The last deleted scene shows Pepper kissing the dead Tony Parker goodbye after having used the Infinity Gauntlet to undo the Thanos Snap. The surviving Avengers kneel on one knee to honor the fallen hero. It is a beautifully heartbreaking moment, and many who have seen it are wondering why it did not make the final cut. The writers explained that they had to delete it because the scenes following it had a similar theme.\\n\\nI Game of Thrones is one of the most popular TV series of all time. Apart from the show being mesmerizing, there are some behind-the-scenes facts that are fascinating too. For instance, Richard Madden, who played Robb Stark, had no idea that his character was going to be so short-lived. In order to portray the character as genuinely as possible, he decided to read the books season after season, instead of reading all of them right away. While he made an effort to be kept in the dark as to his characters future, he made the terrible mistake of going on Google. There, he found out what was going to happen after reading fan comments hinting at his brutal murder. II While we are all used to pronouncing Daenerys title as ka-lee-see, Dothraki linguist David Peterson says its actually not the right way to say it. In fact, the common mispronunciation of the word has become something of an annoyance for him. He explains that there are three acceptable ways to pronounce the term: khal-eh-si, khal-ee-si, and kal-ee-si. III The season finale of Game of Thrones received much criticism, even from the shows most loyal fans. In fact, Charles Dance, who played Tywin Lannister, admitted to feeling confused after having seen the finale as he had hoped to see Tyrion Lannister on the throne. On the other hand, Sophie Turner, who played Sansa Stark, loved the ending and found it disrespectful that people are demanding the finale to be re-shot. IV During the filming of the Battle of the Bastards, the shows camera operator, Sean Savage, shared that the scene where Jon Snow had to be trampled by hordes of dead people was not completely scripted. As such, they had to have a safe word for Kit Harrington to utter if he felt he was at risk of being genuinely harmed. V Hafr Jlus Bjrnsson, the Icelandic actor who plays Gregor The Mountain Clegane, was the first person to win Europes Strongest Man, Worlds Strongest Man, and Arnold Strongman Classic awards within the same year. As such, it doesnt come as a surprise that he has never used a stunt double in filming his scenes for GoT; except during season eight, that is. Apparently, that fight to the death scene with Rory McCann proved to be too brutal even for the 69 actor. VI Before the season finale was aired, many speculations and theories circled the internet about the possible ending of the show. Epidemiologists Reidar Lystad and Benjamin Brown even studied the shows mortality trends and provided statistics-based predictions. Impressively, they were right in forecasting the deaths of Daenerys and Cersei, and the survival of Sansa, Arya, Tyrion, and Jon.\\n\\nI The Haunting of Hill House immediately became the talk of the town when it aired on Netflix. While the show in itself is amazing, filming it produced some pretty interesting stories too. For example, while the show had a bittersweet ending, director Mike Flanagan initially had a different plan. It was supposed to get far more brutal. He meant it to end with the family being together but stuck in the Red Room. However, he grew to love the characters so much that he at least wanted to give them a little bit of hope after all their struggles. II Flanagan initially wanted the show to tell the stories of Hill Houses previous residents. He had written extensive backstories about each ghost, and wanted to allow five minutes at the beginning of each episode to share their history. Sadly, due to budget and time limitations, he decided to focus more on the story of the Crains. III Unlike other TV series that film one episode after another, the Haunting of Hill House was filmed as if it was a 10-hour movie. This proved to be exhausting for both the cast and crew, as they had to shoot three episodes at a time. It was like filming five movies simultaneously. IV The 2018 Netflix series is actually not the first adaptation of the Shirley Jackson novel. The first came in 1963, titled The Haunting, starring Julie Harris and Claire Bloom, and directed by Robert Wise. In 1999, a second film adaptation was released starring Catherine Zeta-Jones and Liam Neeson. Stephen King also did a remake in 2002, which aired as a miniseries entitled Rose Red. V Elizabeth Reaser, who portrayed the eldest Crain, Shirley, watched a ton of embalming footage to prepare for the series. Her character was a mortician and the director of a funeral parlor, and she had to do a lot of research to familiarize herself with the character. Aside from watching video clips, she also looked at a whole lot of photos of dead bodies. VI The shows creators intentionally hid a lot of ghosts while shooting. Some ghosts were placed in plain view, some subtly hidden, and some you can barely even see. Perhaps the creepiest part about it is how the show never called attention to these ghosts. This makes spotting these easter eggs all the more exciting.\\n\\nI The film and real-life versions of Bohemian Rhapsody have quite a few points of differentiation. In the film, Freddie Mercury meets Mary Austin, his future fiance, a few seconds before he meets his future bandmates, Brian May and Roger Taylor. However, in reality, it was actually May who dated Austin first. Austin and Mercury dated eventually, at a time when Mercury was already the bands lead singer. II In the movie, Freddie told his bandmates about his HIV infection prior to their Live Aid performance. While it was a truly heartwarming scene, it did not really happen. In reality, the brilliant singer had no idea he had the sickness until 1987. He announced his condition in public in 1991, two days before passing away. III In the movie, Mike Myers portrayed a cynical EMI executive, who didnt have very good words to say about the song, Bohemian Rhapsody. Interestingly, in the film, Waynes World, a scene showed his character singing the song with his buddies. Also, to be clear, Queen never broke their contract with EMI. While they did have some arguments, they continued to work together. IV In the films storyline, the bands break-up was caused by Mercurys desire to pursue a solo career. His bandmates tried to persuade him not to leave, but he had already made up his mind. In real life, all of the members were actually moving on to solo careers. In 1981, Taylor released an album entitled Fun in Space. V The original Wembley Stadium that held the Live Aid concert in 1985 was demolished in 2002-2003. In order to shoot Queens Live Aid performance, the filmmakers had to replicate the stadium at a London airfield. The concerts director was amazed to see the stadium as it was perfectly replicated, down to the very last detail. VI Marc Martel, a Canadian singer, lent his voice when shooting the film. While the public is only now discovering how talented he is, band members Brian May and Roger Taylor were already aware of his incredible talent. A few years ago, Martel sent the two a recording of his Queen covers. They were so impressed at how similar his voice was to Mercurys that they had him perform their songs in a band tribute in 2012.\\n\\nI So much controversy has surrounded the HBO documentary, Leaving Neverland, ever since it premiered in January of this year. The two-part program explicitly details the alleged sexual abuse that Dwayne Robson and James Safechuck experienced as children at the hands of legendary pop icon, Michael Jackson. While countless people believe the claims and were disgusted by Jacksons deeds, many are also convinced that the two accusers are spreading false testimonies. II The documentary revolved around the formula Jackson allegedly used to attract, abuse, and brainwash little boys. He targeted boys who came from problematic families and groomed them with gifts, toys, and promises of a successful career. The film also detailed Jacksons purported fetishes and how he performed sexual acts with the boys. As the pop icon preferred young boys, the abuse stopped when the kids reached puberty. He would then target another victim and continue the vicious cycle. III Right after the documentarys release, Oprah hosted After Neverland, a post-film interview with Robson, Safechuck, and the director, Dan Reed. During the interview, Oprah expressed her full support for the documentary and Jacksons alleged victims. She explained that the story is so much bigger than Michael Jackson or any other person. She also lauded the director for being able to explain sexual abuse and sexual seduction, something that she had been attempting to do for years, in just four hours. IV Since its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, the film has received immense backlash, aimed at Robson and Safechuck. Many people question the integrity of their stories as some details do not add up. For instance, Safechuck claims that he was abused in the Neverland train station from the years 1988 to 1992. However, the station was only built in 1994. A tweet from Mike Smallcombe, Michael Jacksons biographer, shared an image of the construction permits that had an approval date of September 1993. V The Jackson family expressed outrage about the documentary, rejecting everything that was said in the film. According to Jacksons three brothers, Jackie, Tito, Marlon, and nephew, Taj, every claim made by Robson and Safechuck is false. They strongly believe that the two are doing this for money. Amidst the controversy, they stand behind their brother and uncle, and have no doubts about his innocence. VI The documentarys aftermath saw a lot of backlash against Jackson too. Louis Vuitton dropped Jackson-inspired apparel and accessories from their 2019 collection. In London, posters declaring Jacksons innocence have been taken down from buses. The icons album sales also declined significantly since the premiere, dropping by 39 percent.\\n\\nI It seems like it was only yesterday that news of Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworths secret wedding broke the internet. The couple, who had been on and off for ten years, tied the knot on December 23, 2018. Sadly, after barely eight months, the two announced their split on Saturday, August 10th. That same day, photos of Cyrus with Kaitlynn Carter, an Italian reality TV actress, started circulating around the internet. II The statement released by Cyrus rep confirms that the two have mutually agreed to take time apart from one another. According to the statement, while the two have decided to be co-parents for their pets, they will be focusing on themselves and their careers separately for now. III Naturally, speculations started to arise from the Miley-Kaitlynn photos, with various news reports claiming that the two have been seeing each other for a few months. Some claim that Liam and Miley actually broke up much earlier than announced, as people spotted Liam not wearing his wedding ring as early as June. Despite the rumors, the reason for their split remains unclear. IV The day after the announced split, Miley took to Instagram to express her thoughts about it all. She advised going against evolution because in doing that, you cant win. She also shares that change is inevitable, and how theres no point fighting it. Meanwhile, in a brief interview with the Daily Mail Australia, Liam asked for privacy, stating, You have no idea how it is. I dont want to talk about it. V The couple met for the first time on the set of the film, The Last Song. The two started dating during the course of filming on Tybee Island in Savannah, Georgia. While they initially denied the relationship, they eventually went public about it in March of 2010, during the movies premiere. They were on and off a few times, but got engaged in June of 2012. However, the engagement was fruitless, with the two splitting in 2013. VI On top of her short-lived marriage, Miley Cyrus sexuality has been the subject of controversy as well. In 2014, she was spotted with actor Patrick Schwarzenegger. Shortly after, she was reported to be dating Stella Maxwell, a Victorias Secret model. In 2015, she put an end to spreading rumors about her sexuality, and came out as pansexual.\\n\\nI Over the weekend, news broke of the death of convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. Reports confirm that the financier committed suicide in his jail cell last Saturday, August 10, while awaiting trial. Epstein was indicted in 2007 for sexually abusing numerous minors. According to reports, he brought underage girls to his mansion, and either masturbated in front of them or had intercourse with them. He served a mere 13-month prison sentence for his crimes. II According to the US Bureaus of Prisons, Epsteins unresponsive body was found on Saturday morning. He was brought to a nearby hospital, but attempts to revive him proved fruitless. Epstein had been locked up in the prisons Special Housing Unit when he took his life. According to an anonymous source, Epstein was taken off suicide watch just prior to the incident. III Jeffrey Epstein was a hedge fund billionaire who used to have connections with the likes of President Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and British royal, Prince Andrew. In 1982, he founded the financial firm J. Epstein and Co., with which he had much success. In 1992, he became the owner of the biggest home in all of Manhattan. He had his very own island, Little St. James, where he ran the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation an institution famous for donating $6.5 million to Harvard University. IV In July of 2019, Epstein was once again arrested for charges relating to sex trafficking. He was alleged to have recruited minors that he then molested in his New York and Palm Beach residences. Had he been tried and convicted, he would have been imprisoned for 45 years. Epstein pleaded not guilty, claiming that all his sexual encounters were consensual and that he thought the women were already 18 at the time. V According to prosecutors, tons of nude photos of young girls were discovered in his Manhattan home. More and more victims have also started coming forward since July. A woman named Jennifer Araoz revealed that she was raped by Epstein when she was 15. Other reports also revealed how the billionaire wanted to spread his DNA throughout the world by impregnating women. VI Because of his death, Epstein managed to escape facing trial for his charges. Some of his accusers expressed their anger and disappointment at how they will no longer be able to seek justice. They are now challenging authorities to investigate those who might have had something to do with Epsteins crimes.\\n\\nI Making a marriage work is challenging enough as it is, but when youre a celebrity, the fact that youre constantly under public scrutiny makes it all the more difficult. Some of the shortest celebrity marriages include Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries. The two were engaged in May of 2011. They were married three months later, but after 72 days of married life, the couple decided to call it quits and filed for a divorce. Many speculate that the failed marriage was a mere publicity stunt to promote the Kardashians reality show, but Kim denied the allegations, firmly asserting that she married for love. II When news broke of the budding romance between One Tree Hill co-stars Chad Michael Murray and Sophia Bush, everybody was over the moon. The couple went on to date for a year before tying the knot in April of 2005. Five months later, however, the two announced their split as Bush filed for an annulment. The request was not granted, leaving them little choice but to go through divorce proceedings. III Cris Judd worked as Jennifer Lopezs back up dance in her music video, Love Dont Cost a Thing, in 2001. Later that year, the two get engaged and married. The marriage lasted only 218 days. According to Judd, while Lopezs love of the limelight was not the primary reason for their split, it definitely contributed to their struggles. He revealed that it was tough having to deal with constant public scrutiny. IV The Handmaids Tale star Elisabeth Moss and Saturday Night Live alum Fred Armisen tied the knot in October of 2009. Eight months later, Moss filed for divorce. She explained that she was very young when they got married. The marriage was, in her words extremely traumatic and awful and horrible, and their split was for the best. V Jason Alexander, for those of you who dont remember, was the childhood friend of pop icon Britney Spears. Apart from being friends, the two shared a very brief romance as well. They got married in Vegas in 2014; however, the wedding was dissolved by a judge just 55 hours later. In an interview with E!, Britney explained that she only did it out of rebellion and silliness. VI While Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodmans marriage officially lasted for over a year, the two actually split up only nine days after their wedding. According to the basketball star, the wedding took place while he was under the influence of alcohol. In her Oprah interview, Electra said that their relationship was very intense and that everything happened way too fast.\\n\\nI The Met Gala is a highly-anticipated annual event in the fashion industry that benefits the Metropolitan Museum of Arts Costume Institute in New York. The fundraiser has been running yearly since 1948 and signals the beginning of the institutes fashion exhibit. Fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert pioneered the tradition as a means to raise money for the Costume Institute. What started as a simple charitable event, the Met Gala, also referred to as the Met Ball, became so prestigious that it was deemed the jewel in the social crown of New York City. II In 1972, under the influence of Diana Vreeland, the Gala started evolving into a much more luxurious event. Apart from New Yorks elites, the event was also graced by several celebrities, including Dianna Ross and Cher. In those years, the Gala moved its venue to the Met (hence the name), and started introducing yearly themes. After the Gala comes a sumptuous handful of months filled with fashion exhibitions. III The Gala has a different theme every year. Apart from setting the tone for the exhibit, it also serves as the inspiration for the guests outfits for the night. At the party, guests get to walk the red carpet to showcase their well-thought-out costumes. A dinner party with performances from various entertainers follows. The most recent Gala themes were 2018s Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination and 2019s Camp: Notes on Fashion. IV While the Met Gala has generally received wide support over the years, it did face criticism for some of its theme choices. For instance, in 2015, it announced its theme to be Chinese Whispers: Tale of the East in Art, Film, and Fashion. The theme was heavily critiqued, with some believing that it contained a subtle form of racism. In response to the backlash, the Gala changed the theme to China: Through the Looking Glass. V Over the years, the Met Gala has seen wonderful and outrageous outfits on its red carpet. Arguably the most controversial outfit of the event was Madonnas 2016 Manus x Machina attire. Her daring outfit, designed by Givenchy, exposed her breasts and buttocks. After receiving much disapproval, Madonna clapped back at her critics, saying that her dress was a political statement that aimed to fight for womens rights. VI In 2018, Rihanna attended the Met Gala with a papal miter on her head. The theme for the year was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, and the pop stars interpretation was met with criticism. Many argued that the outfit was blasphemous and sacrilegious. Ironically, Timothy M. Dolan, a cardinal, attended the event. He even joked about being the one who lent the headdress to Rihanna.\\n\\nI The relationship between singer-songwriters Taylor Swift and Katy Perry has been an emotional rollercoaster not just for the two, but for all fans who followed their saga. Finally, the decade-long feud came to a peaceful end when the two saw it in their hearts to patch things up. In Taylor Swifts most recent music video, You Need to Calm Down, the two share a heartwarming scene that confirms their reconciliation. II The pop icons started out as friends. They were often spotted chatting at award ceremonies, and Swift even tweeted in 2009 how much she adored Perry. In turn, Perry replied that she wanted the two to write a song together. During Swifts Fearless tour, the pair shared the stage and performed a duet of Perrys single, Hot N Cold. III In 2009, speculations started to surface that Taylor Swift and singer-songwriter John Mayer were going out. While it was never confirmed, Swifts painful break-up song, Dear John, was rumored to have been about Meyer. A few years later, news broke that Perry and Meyer were dating. Many people suspect that this was what kicked off the feud between the two stars. IV In 2014, their feud was confirmed when Perry reportedly stole Swifts dancers. Swift was in the middle of her world tour when her dancers asked permission from Swift to join Perrys tour. As the schedules were in conflict with one another, it meant that theyd have to skip half of Swifts tour. Swift then clapped back with a star-studded music video for Bad Blood, a song that basically declared war against Perry. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Swift expressed how Perry tried to sabotage her by hiring her dancers. V After the release of the Rolling Stone article, Perry posted on Twitter a cryptic message that seemed to allude to Swifts interview, stating Watch out for the Regina George in sheeps clothing. In 2017, she released a single entitled Swish, Swish which people believe to be her response to Bad Blood. In an interview with James Corden in his Carpool Karaoke segment, Perry finally addressed the feud, explaining how it was Swift who started it. VI Shortly after her chat with Corden, Perry expressed in another interview that she was ready to let the whole feud go. She said she had forgiven Swift and was sorry for everything she did to spark the fire. In 2018, Perry sent Taylor a literal olive branch, which Swift shared on her Instagram account. Finally, in 2019, Perry posted a photo of a plate of cookies with an icing inscription saying, peace at last. The cookies were sent to her by none other than Swift.\\n\\nI Stranger Things is one of the most successful series produced by Netflix. While the show itself is binge-worthy, the stories behind the scenes are just as fascinating. For instance, Bob Newby, that well-loved character introduced (and sadly, killed off) during the second season of the series, was portrayed by Sean Astin. Initially, the Duffer brothers were not too keen on having Astin on board as they thought him being a famous geek icon would be too distracting for fans. Even once they agreed to take him on, they planned to have his character killed off early, but they loved Astins portrayal so much they decided to keep him in the show much longer. II Bob Newby was originally intended to be killed by Will in the earlier episodes. But Astin managed to convince the Duffer brothers to give his character a longer run on the show and an even more epic death. Fortunately, the showrunners agreed, hence that brutal but heroic death. III To find the best actors and actresses for the series, casting director Carmen Cuba had the Duffer brothers audition a total of 1,213 kids. For their audition pieces, the child actors had to read scenes from the first episode and the film, Stand By Me. Interestingly, casting for the role of Dustin was a no-brainer for the team; they handed it to Gaten Matarazzo right away. IV The casting for Eleven took the widest and most massive search, and fortunately for Millie Bobby Brown, she had one of the best recommendations. Stephen King was so impressed by her acting chops in the BBC show, Intruders, that he publicly lauded her on Twitter. Obviously, its never a bad thing to have such an influential man on your side. Not that we think she only got the part because of the referral, though. We think Millie is awesome! V Among all the characters in the series, Eleven is arguably the most memorable. Remember that pink dress and blonde wig that she wore in season 1? Apparently, this outfit was not just randomly thrown on Eleven, but rather, an homage to E.T. Aside from being a cool easter egg, it also serves as a clue to her character. Elevens role is actually inspired by the beloved alien. When explaining the role to Millie, the Duffer brothers asked her to have E.T. and his relationship with the kids in mind. VI While there arent really any demogorgons walking in our midst, an important plot point in the show is actually based on real conspiracy theories. Many people speculate that the US government experiments on children. A lot of the scenes involving Eleven in a lab were inspired by the experiments that supposedly took place in the Montauk Project.\\n\\nI The five new cast members of the Queer Eye reboot have been under immense pressure, right from the start. Fortunately, the new Fab Five managed to meet everyones expectations, and then some. Among the five, we bet your favorite Queer Eye member is Jonathan Van Ness, the charming and flamboyant cutie whose mannerisms make him stand out from the rest. Did you know that before being cast in the reboot, he was already making waves in the digital world? In 2013, Van Ness launched the podcast, Gay of Thrones, a hilarious parody of Game of Thrones. The show is so funny it even got nominated for an Emmy in 2016. II Tan France, the lovable British member of the group, is loved for his fun but calm demeanor. In the show, he is responsible for finding a style that perfectly suits their guests. In real life, Tan has his own fashion label. Called Kingdom & State. The London-based clothing company sells womens clothing and ships internationally. As if thats not amazing enough, Tan also works as a partner in Rachel Parcell, another clothing line. III One of the best parts of the show is the house make-over. Every viewer looks forward to seeing how the brilliant Bobby Berk will transform a messy and plain room into a stylish and efficient space. Bobby truly knocks it out of the park every time. Along with having a kick-ass professional life, hes doing equally well in his personal life. He has been married to his partner, Dewey, for more than five years. IV Does Karamo Brown, the shows culture guy, look familiar but you just cant pinpoint where youve seen him before? Well, let me help you. He was part of the cast of the 2004 MTV show, Real World: Philadelphia. In fact, he was the first openly gay black man to ever appear in a reality show. Before being cast in Queer Eye, he also hosted other shows, such as Dr. Drew on Call and Are You the One: Second Chances. V Aside from being an expert cook, Antoni Porowski is an accomplished actor. You can see him in Love Elliott, Blacklist, and The Pretenders. Just recently, the Canadian starred in the Netflix original thriller, Dont Watch This. He bagged the Queer Eye job as the food and wine expert because, apart from his obvious talent, his chill and mysterious persona was very appealing. VI Anyone who grew up in the 90s would be aware that the show is a reboot of the amazing Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. The original aired in 2003 and lasted for five seasons and 100 episodes. The show was such a massive success that the reboot received a whole lot of pressure to perform equally, if not better. Amazingly, the five did not disappoint.\\n\\nI Even 25 years later, the legendary sitcom Friends is still just as popular as ever. Because it is available on the streaming platform, Netflix, the show is gaining millions of brand-new followers all over the world. But did you know that it wasnt originally called Friends? Co-creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane initially called the show Insomnia Caf. Other titles considered were Friends Like Us, Across the Hall, and Six of One. II Casting for the characters didnt come easy. The showrunners initially considered casting Jane Lynch or Kathy Griffin for the role of Phoebe. For Chandler, casting agents considered Jon Cryer and Jon Favreau. Matthew Perry was busy shooting another pilot, LAX 2194, and almost didnt get the part. Courtney Cox was the most famous among the cast at the time. She was initially intended to play Rachel, but the actress chose to play Monica. III Filming one episode usually took five hours. Each scene had to be shot several times, and a 20-minute period between scenes had to be allotted for set changes. Despite the challenges in filming, the show was shot in front of a live audience. This set-up was favorable for the actors, as it helped them gauge whether the jokes were funny enough. However, to avoid spoilers, cliffhangers were shot without a live audience. IV Paul Swain, a crew from the electric department, had the fun responsibility of drawing on the Magna Doodle on Joey and Chandlers apartment door. Over the years, fans enjoyed checking out the doodles as they offered fun easter eggs relating to each episode. When the show ended, Matt LeBlanc took the Magna Doodle with him. The board also appeared in some episodes of the spin-off, Joey. V By 2004, Jennifer Aniston had gotten so famous and in demand, that she almost did not make it to the final season. The success of the show plus her marriage to then-hubby, Brad Pitt, drastically intensified her celebrity status. Aniston revealed that she was skeptical about going back for another season, as she didnt think she still had enough Rachel in her to go on. Fortunately, the actress said yes to one final season. VI Who can forget Bruce Willis guest appearance on the show as Paul, the smoking hot dad who briefly dated Rachel? Apparently, Willis lost a bet with Matthew Perry, prompting him to donate his salary from the episodes to charity. The bet was about the success of their film, The Whole Nine Yards. Perry bet that the movie would rank number one in the box office on its first weekend, and he was right.\\n\\nI Apart from being a best-selling author of The Life-changing Magic of Tidying Up: the Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing, Marie Kondo is the star of her very own Netflix show, as well. The KonMari method has become a cultural hit that continues to inspire people to declutter their rooms and office spaces. The Japanese philosophy might prove too taxing for some, but many swear by its effectiveness. II The KonMari method discourages people from buying storage products such as racks and shelves. To Marie Kondo, your house may look neat, but its just an illusion. Your stuff is still lying around the house somewhere and thats not really solving the clutter issue. III Marie Kondo believes that her method is applicable to all personalities. So, regardless of what psychological issues led you to becoming a hoarder, following the KonMari method will still be effective. When trying out the technique, make sure to follow every step as is customizing it based on your personal preference is not an option. IV The first thing the KonMari method teaches is how to discard unused and unnecessary items in your life. The idea is, the less stuff you have, the easier it is to clean up. The technique encourages people to focus on long-term decluttering instead of doing a weekly, monthly, or yearly clean-up. It should also be treated as a special event instead of just another chore. V When deciding which stuff to keep, the method requires you to hold each item and ask the question, Does this spark joy? If you answered yes, its for keeps. If you answered no, then its time to go. Start this process with your clothes. You may break them down into categories such as tops, bottoms, socks, et cetera. Do the same with books, papers, miscellaneous stuff, and lastly, mementos. VI The discarding process must be treated as a private, confidential event. Lets face it, you cant really concentrate and answer the spark joy question without your spouse or family member having a giggle at your expense. You have to focus on your own belongings too, as you cant discard somebody elses possessions without asking for permission.\\n\\nI 2019 has brought many new trends in fashion, lifestyle, technology, and even the corporate world. While most companies still abide by the regular 9-5 work schedule, many have started adapting the flexible work hours concept. Instead of focusing on the number of hours worked, this concept centers on ones output and quality of work. This idea is perfect, especially for parents who need to balance responsibilities at work and at home. (group a) II Plant-based living has become increasingly popular in the food industry over recent years. The concept has been so well-received it has even started to spread to fashion and skincare. Those who have started to adopt the lifestyle reported having a much healthier diet. They also find having an animal-friendly approach to consuming food and other products quite fulfilling. III Technology has become so advanced that its now found its way into clothing creation. In fact, schools in China have adopted the use of smart uniforms school outfits that have a built-in chip that tracks the whereabouts of its owner. While the innovation has posed concerns regarding privacy, schools are hopeful that it will help address the proliferation of class-cutting. IV Apart from clothing, smart technology has infiltrated electrical devices as well, such as speakers. Various companies such as Google, Apple, and Amazon, have released smart speakers that have the capacity to play music, switch lights on and off, set alarms, and even teach you a foreign language. These automated machines can do these things for you and more with just one vocal command. V We were collectively introduced to the amazing technology that is virtual reality a few years ago, but we can expect more of it to come this year. Numerous gaming and fitness companies are now starting to introduce VR into their roster of platforms. Since technology is becoming more and more affordable, sooner or later, these devices will become easily accessible to the public. VI One of the major contributors to pollution is transportation. As such, to help minimize the harsh effects of travel, some people have switched to eco-tourism. Basically, the idea is to travel without leaving any traces that could harm the environment or native wildlife. Examples of such initiatives include staying in local inns instead of expensive hotels and participating in community service instead of just going sight-seeing.\\n\\nI Over the years, weve seen so many food trends come and go, such as ramen burgers, matcha, and spiked ice-cream. Nowadays, were seeing another trend making waves in the food industry. How many times today have you seen an Instagram photo of a scoop of black ice cream, or a cup of black yogurt, or hamburgers with black buns? Indeed, the charcoal trend has taken the world by storm. II So, what gives your latte that deep black shade? Activated charcoal, or coconut ash, is produced by heating coconut shells to insanely high temperatures until theyre burnt to a crisp. The ashes are then increased in size by steaming at high temperatures. Through this process, the ashes become a strong detoxifier, mostly because they become extra absorbent. This product may be purchased in pill form, and promises to alleviate hangovers, minimize the effects of food poisoning, and fight the visible signs of aging. III Activated charcoal is said to boost ones energy as a result of decreasing toxins in the body. However, no evidence proves that detoxifying can lead to increased energy. Also, while it can help cure a hangover, it doesnt necessarily remove alcohol from your blood. It is also said to aid in debloating your stomach because it cleanses your colon but again, this all anecdotal and isnt supported by scientific evidence as of yet. All we can say for sure is that it is a proven detoxifier. IV Because of the increasing popularity of the trend, doctors have started weighing in on its efficacy. According to gastroenterologist Patricia Raymond, activated charcoal is so absorbent that it is used in the medical field to counteract drug and alcohol overdoses. However, this also means that when you consume charcoal-infused food while using prescription medication, the charcoal will likely absorb the drug, making it ineffective. Kim Harms from the American Dental Association also advised against using charcoal toothpaste as there is no proof of the ingredients effectiveness. V The next question to ask is, does it make food tastier? Sadly, nope. Activated charcoal is tasteless, so apart from making your food look Halloween-ready, you wont get any additional flavor. Ordering a charcoal vanilla ice cream will still taste exactly like vanilla. So basically, this food trend is really all about aesthetics, making food look more exciting but doing little else. VI Considering that activated charcoal-infused foods are more expensive than the regular versions, the trend may soon lose its appeal. While activated charcoal is not really bad for you, it doesnt offer significant healthful benefits either. However, it does, without a doubt, make for an impressive and Instagram photo.\\n\\nI News of the live-action remake of the Disney classic, The Little Mermaid, has been met with enthusiasm and excitement. While we do not know exactly when the film will be released, we do know that the lead character will be played by Halle Bailey. Javier Bardem is likely to play the strict but loving dad, King Triton. Harry Styles was initially thought to be playing Prince Eric, but recent news reveals he wont be taking on the role. II The original animated film was released in 1989 and marked the start of the Disney Renaissance. For ten consecutive years, Disney successfully created one animated movie after another. Now, 30 years later, a highly anticipated reboot is finally on its way. While fans are excited, casting has become controversial as some people have a problem with Ariel no longer being a redhead. III Disney recently announced that Halle Bailey, 19, will be taking the role of Ariel. It is a bold move for the company which is known for being a proponent of colorblind casting. While rumors spread about Zendaya possibly bagging the role, the singer-actress expressed her excitement for Bailey in a tweet. IV The Oscar-winning score will be updated by none other than Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. He will also be co-producing the film along with Marc Platt. It will be directed by Chicago director, Rob Marshall. The script was written by Jane Goldman, the same writer responsible for the scripts of The Woman in Black and Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children. V According to reports, the role of Ursula might go to comedian Melissa McCarthy. Meanwhile, Jacob Tremblay is rumored to be playing Flounder, and rapper Awkwafina will apparently play Scuttle, the seagull. Other actors have expressed their desire to join the cast, too, with Chris Evans saying hed be down to play Prince Eric, and Lindsay Lohan expressing a desire to be Ariel. VI While everyone is extremely excited to see the reboot, filming isnt scheduled to start until 2020. In the meantime, you may watch another remake of the film on Netflix. The story is a lot different from the original, though, so consider yourself warned.\\n\\nI Louisa May Alcotts Little Women is a classic novel thats been the subject of several TV and film adaptations. As a matter of fact, another one is currently in the works and is set to be released on Christmas day, 2019. This most recent adaptation is directed by Lady Bird director, Greta Gerwig. The novel follows the lives of the four March sisters who lived in New England during the Civil War. II Just like the 1994 version, Gerwigs adaptation has an all-star cast. Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet play the lead characters, Jo March and Theodore, Laurie/Teddy Laurence. Emma Watson is the eldest March sister, Meg. Meanwhile, playing the youngest sibling, Amy, is Midsommar star, Florence Pugh. The frail sister Beth is going to be played by Eliza Scanlen. III While Marmee, the March matriarch plays a significant role in the book, the film will focus more on Great Aunt March as the primary mother figure of the girls. To everyones excitement, the role was given to the wonderful Meryl Streep. The role of Marmee, meanwhile, will be played by Laura Dern. IV The classic novel was first published in 1868. The setting is 1860s Concord, Massachusetts, the hometown of author Louisa May Alcott. Interestingly, the story of the four sisters was actually inspired by Alcotts real childhood experiences with her siblings. Jos character is a representation of Alcott herself. The only difference between the two is that Jo married and Alcott did not. V Louisa May Alcott was an American feminist. She grew up reading the Declaration of Sentiments, a book about womens suffrage. She was also the first woman to register to vote in Concord. She was a member of an all-female authors club, all of whom wrote about various womens rights issues in their novels. Other members included Rebecca Harding Davis, Anne Moncure Crane, and Elizabeth Stoddard. VI After the release of the novels first installment, fans kept requesting Alcott to have Jo and Laurie get married. However, Alcott felt strongly against this, saying that people should not see marriage as the only way to write a happy ending. In the end, Alcott had Jo marry Professor Bhaer, while Laurie ended up with Amy instead.\\n\\nI When we hear the words influencer and internet star we tend to naturally think of our fellow human beings. However, this isnt always the case. Many human superstars and celebrities share the internet spotlight with animals. From personal pets to wild zoo residents, the internet has become the stage for some of the most popular and influential animals online. (group a) II Grumpy Cat, or Tardar Sauce as she was known to her human parents, became front and center of the animal meme and viral video world when she debuted on a picture sporting her signature grumpy look. Her small size, which was caused by feline dwarfism, only made her even more lovable, and though she has passed away, she is still fondly remembered to this day. (group b) III Kabosu, named after a Japanese citrus fruit, is a female Shiba Inu that became the internet meme Doge, bringing fun silly smiles to everyone who sees her. Not only was she almost not famous, the pup nearly didnt get a chance at life at all. Had she not been adopted by her parent Atsuko Sato back in 2008, Kabosu would have been put to sleep after her animal shelter was closed. (group c) IV Another lovable dog in this list is Boo. Dubbed The Worlds Cutest Dog, this Pomeranian is living a true influencer lifestyle. With over 1.4 million fans on Facebook and his own published book, Boo is cute and talented. Even his haircut has been trademarked. Its fitting that he has conquered social media because his owner is a longstanding Facebook employee. (group d) V Wilfred Warrior, who captured the internet with his viral video collaboration with actor Michael Rapaport, is a Chinchilla Persian cat with a weird but lovable look. According to Rapaport, the kittys bulging eyes and crooked teeth look like my grandma. Dont worry, he is a healthy cat with nothing to worry about, except maybe the 1.1 million Instagram fans who cant get enough of him. (group e) VI Larry the Pit Bull may not be as big a star as the previous ones, but his influencer mission is perhaps the most important: to change the stereotype that Pit Bulls are dangerous, vicious animals. His social media presence shows everything but violence and danger. He takes his mission so seriously that he has become the Grand Marshall of the Indy Pit Crews Pit Bull Awareness Walk. (group f)\\n\\nI Watching a horror movie is a great way to spend an evening with your significant other, your friends, or even alone. But you dont need to go to the movies to get your fear-fix. Just hop on Netflix and pick from their wide selection of thrillers, and get scared right in the comfort of your own home. (group a) II Perhaps Netflixs biggest horror hit so far is The Haunting of Hill House. Its so scary and well made that even acclaimed horror author Stephen King was impressed. One important tidbit when watching the show is the fact that the director had placed a whole host of hidden ghosts in the background of many scenes throughout the series ten-episode run. So, happy ghost hunting! (group b) III Another brilliant Netflix horror-thriller is Bird Box, a film based on a novel of the same name. Starring Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich, the Netflix film was a huge hit. A testament to Sandra Bullocks dedication to her craft, she genuinely could not see during the scenes she had a blindfold on, only compromising to remove a layer when she would carry the children. (group c) IV One recent addition is a movie from the Philippines called Eerie. Set in an all-girls Catholic school, the movie is said to be so scary that Twitter users reactions range from Ive screamed 3 times in 20 minutes to Ill be sleeping with the lights on for a week. The movie was actually an entry in the Singapore International Film Festival back in December of 2018. (group d) V Another Netflix original film is The Perfection, a movie about cellists that takes the viewer through various twists, turns, and surprises. We dont want to give anything away, so lets just say theres more to this movie than meets the eye. In the final climactic scene, actors Allison Williams and Logan Browning really played a single Cello together, with each actor using one hand each. (group e) VI Perhaps the most popular horror movie on Netflix today is James Wans The Conjuring. Starring Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, this movie scared so many people in theaters and at home that it spawned its own series of sequels and spinoffs. The haunted doll in the movie, Annabelle, really exists and is actually a Raggedy Ann Doll. (group f)\\n\\nI The upcoming Witcher series on Netflix is at the center of many fandoms this year: fans of the original Witcher books, fans of the widely popular Witcher video games by CD Projekt Red, and fans of superstar and character lead, Henry Cavill. Despite garnering some controversy due to its casting choices, most are excited for this new show. II The Witcher books, by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, follow the character Geralt on his adventures in the lands of an unnamed continent that is said by many to be a fantasy version of Poland. The books, eight in total, have been translated into over 20 languages and have become a big hit, even beyond Europe. III The series was originally called Wiedmin, a Polish word, but was translated into Witcher by Adrian Chmielarz, the director of Polish video game company Metropolis Software. They were the ones who first attempted to turn Sapkowskis creation into a video game, but their project was canceled. IV It wasnt until 2007 that the first Witcher video game was released. Created by CD Projekt Red, this first game set the stage for a few spinoffs and two main sequels, each one becoming more successful than the last. Indeed, the third and final installment, Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, is the most critically acclaimed of the lot. V In the end, it would be the video games, not the books, that would attract superstar Henry Cavill to the project, even though the show will follow the books and not the games. He said he is a huge fan of the Witcher game series, and when he first heard of Netflixs planned show, he sent his agents to work to make sure he would get the part. VI Cavill is no stranger to video games. He almost failed to land the role of Superman because he was busy playing the game World of Warcraft when Man of Steel director Zack Snyder called him. Fortunately, he called the director back and was cast as the superhero. His genuine game fandom has made Cavill an even more popular star and could be the deciding factor in the Netflix shows success.\\n\\nI The live-action Mulan remake is one of the most anticipated Disney reboots of all time, marking a breakthrough in movies of its type with its fully-Asian cast and script that sticks closer to the original story than the animated version. It is expected to be a huge hit, and much of it rides on the shoulders of the movies star-studded cast. II Liu Yifei, who plays the titular role, beat out 1,000 other actresses for the part and is currently one of Chinas most bankable actresses. She has the nickname Fairy Sister due to her breakout role in the 2005 series Chinese Paladin. Liu is also a fashion model, a role shes been working in since she was just eight years old. III She is also an avid lover of cats, and actually has a habit of finding new homes for stray cats with her mother. They even went as far as converting their Beijing apartment into a cat sanctuary that housed as many as 30 cats at one point. That is surely going to win her some internet points! IV Co-star Jet Li, who has been cast as the Emperor of China, has actually already starred with Liu Yifei in a Hollywood movie before the fantasy kung-fu blockbuster Forbidden Kingdom, with the legendary Jackie Chan. Jet Li is already a Hollywood star, but due to being diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, he slowed down his work schedule, taking it easy until the Mulan role came up. V Playing the mentor figure Commander Tung to Yifeis Mulan, actor Donnie Yen is also a legend in his own right. You may recognize him as the star of the Ip Man movie franchise. Like Li, Yen has already starred in some Hollywood hits like Shanghai Knights 2 and more recently, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. VI As one of the villains, the witch Xian Lang, Singaporean superstar Gong Li is a good foil to young Yifei. She is widely credited as one of the driving forces that helped bring Chinese cinema to the West. It makes it all the more interesting to know then, that Gong Li actually avoided Hollywood for many years because she lacked confidence in her English speaking abilities.\\n\\nI KPop has invaded the States and Europe in recent years and garnered millions of fans all over the world. KPop Idols are loved for their looks as much as their talent. They each carve a unique persona for themselves, drawing in a legion of dedicated fans. But becoming a KPop Idol isn't a walk in the park and isn't as simple as knowing how to sing. II KPop idols are selected at a very young age, and are actually sent to specially designed environments where they learn how to sing, dance, and understand foreign languages. Music companies can invest as much as $3 million per candidate because of this. It is a method that many in the West don't agree with, but the results are undeniable. III However, the KPop process can be a double-edged sword for many idols. While they can rise to superstardom, most will only feel the monetary rewards of their efforts after the investment of the music label on them has been returned. So, if it takes $3 million to ready the trainee for their debut, they need to earn that money back for the company before they even have a hope of being independently wealthy. IV Considering that there can be as many 100 groups debuting in South Korea each year, and with only 5% on average ending up successful, this can be problematic to both the idols and the companies that back them. Fortunately, however, there are some companies that dont make the new idols return their investment that way. V If an idol or idol group succeeds, the rewards can last decades. For instance, some idol groups that were formed back in the late 90s, such as Sechs Kies and Shinhwa, have become successful and loved to the point that even up to now, they are still very popular with the next generation of South Koreans. VI Today, KPop is so massive all over the world that many terms that used to be only used in South Korea are becoming part of our global vernacular. Sasaengs, or people obsessed with KPop idols, exist around the globe, buying merchandise, attending concerts, and supporting their Oppa faithfully.\\n\\nI Fashion is always evolving. Todays top fashion trends for women are mostly new, but some are inspired by styles from earlier years. For instance, we all thought that puff shoulders were safely in the past, but, they are making their way back to fashion. This year is all about oversized silhouettes, and with these shapes have come bold ruffles and statement shoulders. These trendy sleeves that were once restricted to the fashion scene of the 1980s have been reborn, enhancing blouses and dresses alike. Fashion tip: when rocking this bold look, make sure that everything else is neutral to avoid being too over-the-top. II Teenie tiny bags are all the rage this year. Unlike previous years, this new bag trend has nothing to do with shape or color. This year, its the size that matters, and the smaller your bag is, the better. These It bags are so small youd be lucky if you could get your phone and lipstick to fit in there. Fashion tip: since these bags arent really serving much of a function, consider buying a regular-sized version of the mini-bag, as well. III Who would have thought that bike shorts looked good with blazers? The unexpected trend showed up on runways early this year, and everybody in the fashion world fell for it. The look is a refreshing mix of sporty and professional styles, offering a chic and striking look. However, while the combination looks amazing, its not quite appropriate for the gym or the office, though it is reminiscent of both. IV Boiler suits showed up in many runway shows during fashion month. These comfy one-piece suits were originally created as a protective garment for laborers, but have recently become the latest trend in the fashion industry. Whats great about the boiler suit is how many design variations and styles there are for you to choose from. V This year, were seeing fashionistas rocking leopard print on their clothes, bags, and shoes. The print can be a little tricky to pull-off, so its a daunting idea for many fashion novices. Hot tip: if you want to follow the trend and unleash your wild side, pick vibrant, bold colors and striking styles. You may opt for a leopard print jumpsuit or you could start incorporating the print in your look by wearing leopard print shoes. VI This years Spring Fashion Month saw a lot of gothic styles flowing in. While the dark look never really went away, it is once again making its way back into the limelight. Pulling off the look is really easy: just wear all-black! Fashion tip: make sure to pair your dark ensemble with trendy pieces to maintain that chic look. Dont be afraid to add a pop of color, either. For instance, wearing dark red lipstick will make your look all the more dark and sexy.\\n\\nI While there are some stylish exceptions, generally speaking, men arent as interested in fashion as women are. As such, they need our help to point them in the right direction, appearance-wise. This year, help your man, dad, or brother learn about mismatched prints. This latest fashion trend is spreading like wildfire: Pinterest is seeing an 89 percent increase in this maximalist style. To achieve the look, start by picking one bold print, then pair it with another. Its really that simple. II When it comes to mens fashion, there often isnt a whole lot to choose from. But this year, were seeing an uptick in variety with men everywhere rocking plaid pants. The edgy wardrobe addition makes a bold statement that can work for any guys look. If your man is afraid to try such a daring look, ease him into it with more subtle styles. Thats whats great about this trend: there are so many prints to choose from. III Men in general value function over style. As such, theyll be really happy to know that sling bags are now making their way into the world of fashion. Apart from being useful, these bags are also sleek and stylish. There are different ways your man can wear the bag; and whether he slings it to the front or the back, its going to look awesome. IV Denim has been a wardrobe staple for ages, and its not going anywhere. The latest trend with these versatile bottoms? Light-washed denim. While men used to prefer darker jeans, this year, we are seeing more and more men switching it up a little and trying out lighter shades. Thankfully, these lighter tones are just as stylish as the darker ones! V Cropped trousers dominated womens fashion last year. This year, theyre back once again this time making their way into the realm of mens fashion. 2019 is all about embracing a bolder and more daring fashion sense, and guys seem really into it: Pinterest shared that searches for cropped trousers for men have increased by a whopping 671 percent. These trousers are best matched up with an edgy pair of socks or sneakers. VI Apart from cropped trousers and light-washed denim, another big trend in mens fashion this year is corduroy. Pinterest searches for these bad boys increased by 507 percent this year. Many clothing brands, such as Urban Outfitters and Lucky Brand, have joined the bandwagon as well, stocking up a-plenty on corduroy outfits.\\n\\nI When it comes to fashion, shoes significantly contribute to the overall aesthetic of your outfit. Lets take a look at the latest trends in footwear today. First up: who says feathers are only for flying? This years latest trend in shoes both heels and flats are feathers. Fashion runways are brimming with this newest fashion style; even Prabal Gurung, Simone Rocha, and Valentino are joining in on the fun. II Sneakers have been around for more than a century. They are classic wardrobe staples that have become essential for people from all walks of life. This year, the latest trend is the vibrant and chunky version of the versatile shoe. These stocky kicks are best paired with a fun top or dress. III We used to make fun of those outdated people who still wore Tevas, but this year, the style is in. Thats right: the criss-cross velcro strappy sandals have managed to become trendy once again. The old designs have been updated into platforms and colorful straps, and people are loving it. In fact, these humble shoes have become so fashionable that they even made their way into New York Fashion Week last year. IV 2019 is all about embracing the weird. When it comes to heels, sculptural designs are the newest trend. From geometric shapes to funky designs, these heels are everywhere. Make sure to get yourself at least one pair of these wearable architectural pieces as they will make any simple outfit more stylish and glamorous. V Barely-there sandals and heels are another hot trend of 2019. These strappy shoes started emerging on runways last year, and they are dominating the fashion industry this year. Various brands, including BY FAR and Zara, are producing these chic shoes that can be tailored to suit a whole host of different occasions. VI Another style thats dominating the fashion world is the nautical theme. It seems numerous designers all had the same idea and started releasing woven shoes this year. Fashion shows such as Ulla and Johnson also started featuring these nautical sandals that are perfect with flowy skirts and dresses.\\n\\nI Cooking at home can be a wonderful experience and is definitely a valid choice when entertaining guests, hosting a dinner date with your spouse or partner, or just enjoying some alone time while watching Netflix. While not all of us have what it takes to be master chefs, we can learn how to cook fantastic meals by following YouTube food channels. II The Buzzfeed channel, Tasty, is one of the most fun cooking YouTube channels today. What makes Tasty so popular? First, most of their videos are only one minute long, which means each dish has been designed to be easy to make. And second, their short videos are so colorful and vibrant your appetite is sure to grow. III Sometimes though, in addition to the food, the host of a channel makes the difference. Food Wishes, run by a quirky, funny man named Chef John, has amassed three million viewers on YouTube, all of whom are excited for his recipes that range from simple dishes to complex feasts. But all you see on the videos are the food. IV Does a cooking YouTube channel have to be run by world class chefs? The answer is a resounding no. Sometimes, the best channels are run by self-taught home cooks, like Binging with Babish. Primarily a filmmaker, Andrew Rea, creator of the channel, is 100% self-taught, but with his skills as a filmmaker, he transformed his channel into a truly entertaining cooking show. V If you feel like re-creating the dishes your mom or grandma used to make, head over to the YouTube channel Laura in the Kitchen. Just like Andrew Rea, she is entirely self-taught, starting her cooking journey in her grandmas kitchen. The Italian-born YouTube chef became so popular on the internet that the Cooking Channel gave her her own show, Simply Laura. VI And lastly, if you want to laugh while learning how to cook recipes in a hilarious way, go to You Suck At Cooking. Dont let the comedy banter fool you, this channel teaches legit recipes that are delicious and simple to make. Just dont let all the laughing youll be doing get in the way of actually cooking your dish!\\n\\nI For the past few years, weve been seeing more and more food halls dominate the retail industry. The craze has swept Los Angeles and New York by storm and is now making its way to Miami. In Magic City alone, ten of these food parks have opened just recently. The mania is even set to triple in size by the year 2020. II Now more than ever, more people have been adopting a vegan lifestyle. A survey in the United Kingdom reveals that 3.5 million residents have turned vegan, while 20 percent have at least tried the concept. People are now wanting to cut down on meat, and the food industry is giving in to the demand. Even wineries have started stocking up on vegan wines. III Due to increased awareness and desire to help the environment, companies have become more committed to eco-friendly food packaging. Previously, companies didnt care much about producing a ton of waste; but now, efforts to reuse, reduce, and recycle are much more apparent. For instance, PepsiCo has committed to creating completely recyclable packaging by the year 2025. IV Who would have thought that young millennials would be into rum? These barrel-aged, small-batch rums are the latest trend in booze, and now even British companies such as Essexs English Spirit are joining in. The spirit is one of the most popular and versatile forms of alcohol, whether it be sweet or strong, dark or white, neat with ice or served with coke. V Nowadays, people have become more accepting of imperfection; when it comes to fresh produce that is. Imperfect Produce is just one of the grocery delivery companies that serve physically flawed fruits and vegetables. This effort is geared toward reducing waste, and the disfigured foods are often turned into hummus, crisps, and juices. VI Various Asian restaurants have been popping up recently, and Sri Lankan cuisine is slowly making its way to the western palate. Sri Lankan dishes such as kottu roti, pol sambol, coconut relish, and hoppers, are being introduced to the market, and people are loving it. Unlike before, the Sri Lankan flavor is finally being recognized as an individual cuisine, separate from Indian food.\\n\\nI Have you lost touch with the music scene recently? Well, here are some of the most popular songs and artists of today. First up: Billie Eilish. The artists eccentric style and the way she whispers her songs have combined to make her a huge hit even Foo Fighters' frontman Dave Grohl has expressed his appreciation for the rocker. II Shawn Mendes is one of those talented performers who could sing the Bible and people are still gonna want to listen. Its no wonder that his most recent song, If I Cant Have You, is hitting the airwaves and topping the charts. The lively and upbeat song is a feel-good tune that will easily brighten up any boring day. III Who better than Beyonc to sing The Lion Kings newest anthem? The song Spirit is the remakes addition to the well-loved soundtrack and features Nalas (a.k.a. Queen B) powerful yet angelic voice. Entitled The Lion King: The Gift, the album is curated by the artist herself as a love letter to Africa. The beautiful ballad starts with a Swahili chant, followed by the angelic voice of Beyonc accompanied by a gospel-esque choir. IV Following Keshas struggle to achieve artistic freedom, she composed and released the heavily loaded song, Rich, White, Straight Men. The single is the singers reaction to the prevailing anti-abortion laws sweeping the nation. The song also addresses other political issues such as LGBTQ rights, equality, and immigration. V Tahliah Debrett Barnett, better known as FKA Twigs, is loved for her genre-bending music. Her most recent single, Cellophane, is a powerful, gut-wrenching song that showcases the singers vocal chops. Accompanied solely by piano music, the haunting song talks about conflicting emotions desire and disgust between two people. VI Sam Smiths single, How Do You Sleep? is the newest addition to his roster of songs for the heartbroken. The song was written by Savan Kotecha, ILYA, and Max Martin. Unlike his previous sad ballads, this time, Smith does something hes never done before (in public, at least): dance. Thats right: in his music video, Smith shows off his skills, dancing his sadness away.\\n\\nI Pantones Color of the Year dictates the color trends that will rule over fashion, lifestyle, and even technology for the entire year. For 2019, the chosen hue is Living Coral. The shade is somewhere in between pink and red, and is a nod to the worlds coral reefs that are at risk of becoming extinct. II Vivid and vibrant colors are also trending nowadays. Bright colors help attract attention, which is very important when conveying a powerful message. 2019 is all about loud designs, so its time to say goodbye to muted tones for now. Expect to see bold color combinations of reds, blues, and yellows take the spotlight moving forward. III Speaking of attracting attention, pink is another hue that has been dominating designs for the past few years. Since 2016, when Rose Quartz and Serenity were Pantones colors of the year, weve seen a spectrum of pinks pop up everywhere. The vibrant shade is so well-received that its expected to stay on-trend for a few years to come. IV One color people cant seem to get enough of is lime green. Based on Shutterstocks reports, it ranks number one in the most-searched color in the United States. Apart from this bright shade, purple and pink are consistently appealing to the public. Experts in color psychology explain that lime green is often associated with feelings of freshness, creativity, and liveliness; so its no wonder that people are obsessed with it. V While loud and vivid colors are all the rage nowadays, some designers still opt for more mellow, natural shades. Earth tones offer a relaxing change to the vibrant colors were seeing so much of lately, so much so that they are actually becoming a rising trend. Ocean blues, leafy greens, oats, and taupes are just some of the shades that offer a more natural and chill vibe. VI Gold has always been a favorite among designers; but because of the recent advancements in technology, its become more popular than ever. And why not? It is an eye-catching shade thats perfect for depicting luxury and extravagance. It can also work as a gleaming enhancement to neutral palettes.\\n\\nI For those who use social media as a digital marketing channel, its critical to learn the best ways to use these ever-changing platforms to your advantage. This year, the most important thing is to show your audience that you care about them. II Another way to show authenticity to your audience is by sharing intimate and raw stories. Letting them join you behind-the-scenes creates the impression that you are sharing secrets with them. Doing so will instantly draw them closer to you, promoting a more meaningful relationship. III This year, everything needs to be mobile-friendly. Gone are the days where people rely on laptops and desktops to check their mail and Facebook messages. At a time where every little thing can be done on your smartphone, its imperative for brands to provide easy and interactive mobile-friendly marketing campaigns. Make sure that all your content is compatible with a mobile device; otherwise, people are going to ignore it. IV This year, the social media trend focuses more on video rather than still images. These cant be just any old clips though you have to have a good strategy for this trend to work for you. Its imperative that you set goals and create a storyboard prior to creating the video. The clip shouldnt go beyond one minute and make sure the first ten seconds are captivating or youll lose your audience. V Social media, just by analyzing the term itself, is really all about promoting social interactions. However, for some reason, brands used social media primarily as a platform to simply advertise and promote their products and services. This year, companies are finally realizing their mistake and making attempts to actually communicate with people. Now, they are starting to build social communities through Facebook Groups. This way, they are able to foster intimate customer and brand relationships. VI It looks like 2019 is the year that LinkedIn gets its glory back. The platform has reintroduced Groups in an effort to foster more virtual social communities. It continuously develops features that are appealing to the younger market as well. As such, its high time for brands to take advantage of the platform.\\n\\nI It comes as no surprise that the most followed Instagram accounts belong to the most popular celebrities today. First up, with 120 million Instagram followers, we have singer-songwriter, Taylor Swift. With more than 50 million albums sold thus far, in 2015, Swift made it to Rolling Stones list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. II With 131 million Instagram followers and counting, Beyonc has truly become the ultimate queen. During the late 90s, we saw the rise of R&B trio, Destinys Child, and fell in love with the talented lead singer. In 2006, the girl-group broke up, which ushered in the era of Beyonc as a solo artist. III At a very young age, Kylie Jenner was exposed to the public through her familys reality show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Despite sharing this fame with her family, Kylie managed to build an empire by herself. With 143 million followers on Instagram, she made it to the list of Time magazines most influential teens in 2014 and 2015. IV As a child actress, Selena Gomez had to grow up in the spotlight. We first started seeing her in the kids shows, Barney & Friends, and Wizards of Waverly Place. Her music career took off soon after, and she has currently sold over seven million albums worldwide. She used to be at the number one spot of the most followed Instagram accounts until she was bumped off by Cristiano Ronaldo in 2018. V We first heard about Kim Kardashian in the early 2000s as the stylist and good pal of fellow socialite, Paris Hilton. In 2007, Kardashians popularity skyrocketed when her sex scandal with then-boyfriend Ray J made the rounds of the internet. Soon after, a reality show depicting the everyday lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family premiered. VI Today, Ariana Grande has 162 million followers on Instagram. In 2008, at just 13 years of age, an already talented young Ariana appeared in the Broadway musical, 13. She then starred in the Nickelodeon series, Victorious, in 2010; as well as the spin-off, Sam & Cat, in 2013. Her first album entitled Yours Truly was released in 2013.\",\n",
              " '\\n\\n\\n\\nLink Copied\\n\\n\\n\\nUpdated at 10:25 a.m. ET on June 17, 2019. 1. The Disappearance At 12:42 a.m. on the quiet, moonlit night of March 8, 2014, a Boeing 777-200ER operated by Malaysia Airlines took off from Kuala Lumpur and turned toward Beijing, climbing to its assigned cruising altitude of 35,000 feet. The designator for Malaysia Airlines is MH. The flight number was 370. Fariq Hamid, the first officer, was flying the airplane. He was 27 years old. This was a training flight for him, the last one; he would soon be fully certified. His trainer was the pilot in command, a man named Zaharie Ahmad Shah, who at 53 was one of the most senior captains at Malaysia Airlines. In Malaysian style, he was known by his first name, Zaharie. He was married and had three adult children. He lived in a gated development. He owned two houses. In his first house he had installed an elaborate Microsoft flight simulator. He flew it frequently, and often posted to online forums about his hobby. In the cockpit, Fariq would have been deferential to him, but Zaharie was not known for being overbearing.\\n\\nTo hear more feature stories, get the Audm iPhone app. In the cabin were 10 flight attendants, all of them Malaysian. They had 227 passengers to care for, including five children. Most of the passengers were Chinese; of the rest, 38 were Malaysian, and in descending order the others came from Indonesia, Australia, India, France, the United States, Iran, Ukraine, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Russia, and Taiwan. Up in the cockpit that night, while First Officer Fariq flew the airplane, Captain Zaharie handled the radios. The arrangement was standard. Zaharie’s transmissions were a bit unusual. At 1:01 a.m. he radioed that they had leveled off at 35,000 feet—a superfluous report in radar-surveilled airspace where the norm is to report leaving an altitude, not arriving at one. At 1:08 the flight crossed the Malaysian coastline and set out across the South China Sea in the direction of Vietnam. Zaharie again reported the plane’s level at 35,000 feet. Eleven minutes later, as the airplane closed in on a waypoint near the start of Vietnamese air-traffic jurisdiction, the controller at Kuala Lumpur Center radioed, “Malaysian three-seven-zero, contact Ho Chi Minh one-two-zero-decimal-nine. Good night.” Zaharie answered, “Good night. Malaysian three-seven-zero.” He did not read back the frequency, as he should have, but otherwise the transmission sounded normal. It was the last the world heard from MH370. The pilots never checked in with Ho Chi Minh or answered any of the subsequent attempts to raise them.\\n\\nPrimary radar relies on simple, raw pings off objects in the sky. Air-traffic-control systems use what is known as secondary radar. It depends on a transponder signal that is transmitted by each airplane and contains richer information—for instance, the airplane’s identity and altitude—than primary radar does. Five seconds after MH370 crossed into Vietnamese airspace, the symbol representing its transponder dropped from the screens of Malaysian air traffic control, and 37 seconds later the entire airplane disappeared from secondary radar. The time was 1:21 a.m., 39 minutes after takeoff. The controller in Kuala Lumpur was dealing with other traffic elsewhere on his screen and simply didn’t notice. When he finally did, he assumed that the airplane was in the hands of Ho Chi Minh, somewhere out beyond his range. The Vietnamese controllers, meanwhile, saw MH370 cross into their airspace and then disappear from radar. They apparently misunderstood a formal agreement by which Ho Chi Minh was supposed to inform Kuala Lumpur immediately if an airplane that had been handed off was more than five minutes late checking in. They tried repeatedly to contact the aircraft, to no avail. By the time they picked up the phone to inform Kuala Lumpur, 18 minutes had passed since MH370’s disappearance from their radar screens. What ensued was an exercise in confusion and incompetence. Kuala Lumpur’s Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre should have been notified within an hour of the disappearance. By 2:30 a.m., it still had not been. Four more hours elapsed before an emergency response was finally begun, at 6:32 a.m. The mystery surrounding MH370 has been a focus of continued investigation and a source of sometimes feverish public speculation. At that moment, the airplane should have been landing in Beijing. The search for it was initially concentrated in the South China Sea, between Malaysia and Vietnam. It was an international effort by 34 ships and 28 aircraft from seven different countries. But MH370 was nowhere near there. Within a matter of days, primary-radar records salvaged from air-traffic-control computers, and partially corroborated by secret Malaysian air-force data, revealed that as soon as MH370 disappeared from secondary radar, it turned sharply to the southwest, flew back across the Malay Peninsula, and banked around the island of Penang. From there it flew northwest up the Strait of Malacca and out across the Andaman Sea, where it faded beyond radar range into obscurity. That part of the flight took more than an hour to accomplish and suggested that this was not a standard case of a hijacking. Nor was it like an accident or pilot-suicide scenario that anyone had encountered before. From the start, MH370 was leading investigators in unexplored directions.\\n\\nThe mystery surrounding MH370 has been a focus of continued investigation and a source of sometimes feverish public speculation. The loss devastated families on four continents. The idea that a sophisticated machine, with its modern instruments and redundant communications, could simply vanish seems beyond the realm of possibility. It is hard to permanently delete an email, and living off the grid is nearly unachievable even when the attempt is deliberate. A Boeing 777 is meant to be electronically accessible at all times. The disappearance of the airplane has provoked a host of theories. Many are preposterous. All are given life by the fact that, in this age, commercial airplanes don’t just vanish. This one did, and more than five years later its precise whereabouts remain unknown. Even so, a great deal about the disappearance of MH370 has come into clearer view, and reconstructing much of what happened that night is possible. The cockpit voice recorder and the flight-data recorder may never be recovered, but what we still need to know is unlikely to come from the black boxes. Instead, it will have to come from Malaysia. 2. The Beachcomber On the evening of the airplane’s disappearance, a middle-aged American man named Blaine Gibson was sitting in his late mother’s house in Carmel, California, sorting through her affairs in preparation for selling the property. He heard the news about MH370 on CNN.\\n\\nGibson, whom I met recently in Kuala Lumpur, is a lawyer by training. He has lived in Seattle for more than 35 years but spends little time there. His father, who died decades ago, was a World War I veteran who endured a mustard-gas attack in the trenches, received a Silver Star for gallantry, and went on to serve as the chief justice of California for more than 24 years. His mother was a graduate of Stanford Law School and an ardent environmentalist. Gibson was an only child. His mother liked to travel internationally, and she took him with her. At the age of 7 he decided that his life’s goal would be to visit every country in the world at least once. Ultimately this challenged the definitions of visit and country, but he stuck with the mission, forgoing any chance of a sustained career and subsisting on a modest inheritance. By his own account, along the way he dabbled in some famous mysteries—the end of the Mayan civilization in the jungles of Guatemala and Belize, the Tunguska meteor explosion in eastern Siberia, and the location of the Ark of the Covenant in the mountains of Ethiopia. He printed up cards identifying himself: adventurer. explorer. truth seeker. He wore a fedora, like Indiana Jones. When news arrived of MH370’s disappearance, he was predisposed to pay attention. Despite reflexive denials by Malaysian officials, and outright obfuscation by the Malaysian air force, the truth about the airplane’s strange flight path quickly began to emerge. It turned out that MH370 had continued to link up intermittently with a geostationary Indian Ocean satellite operated by Inmarsat, a commercial vendor in London, for six hours after the airplane disappeared from secondary radar. This meant that the airplane had not suddenly suffered some catastrophic event. During those six hours it is presumed to have remained in high-speed, high-altitude cruising flight. The Inmarsat linkups, some of them known as “handshakes,” were electronic blips: routine connections that amounted to the merest whisper of communication, because the intended contents of the system—passenger entertainment, cockpit texts, automated maintenance reports—had been isolated or switched off. All told, there were seven linkups: two initiated automatically by the airplane, and five others initiated automatically by the Inmarsat ground station. There were also two satellite-phone calls; they went unanswered but provided additional data. Associated with most of these connections were two values that Inmarsat had only recently begun to log.\\n\\nThe first and more accurate of the values is known as the burst-timing offset, or what I will call the “distance value.” It is a measure of the transmission time to and from the airplane, and therefore of the plane’s distance from the satellite. It does not pinpoint a single location but rather all equidistant locations—a roughly circular set of possibilities. Given the range limits of MH370, the near-circles can be reduced to arcs. The most important arc is the seventh and last one—defined by a final handshake tied in complex ways to fuel exhaustion and the failure of the main engines. The seventh arc stretches from Central Asia in the north to the vicinity of Antarctica in the south. It was crossed by MH370 at 8:19 a.m., Kuala Lumpur time. Calculations of likely flight paths place the airplane’s intersection with the seventh arc—and therefore its end point—in Kazakhstan if the airplane turned north, or in the southern Indian Ocean if it turned south. Judging from the electronic evidence, this was not a controlled attempt at a water landing. The airplane must have fractured instantly into a million pieces. Technical analysis indicates with near certainty that the airplane turned south. We know this from Inmarsat’s second logged value—the burst-frequency offset. For the sake of simplicity, I will refer to this value as the “Doppler value,” because it includes, most crucially, a measure of radio-frequency Doppler shifts associated with high-speed movement in relation to satellite position, and is a natural part of satellite communications for airplanes in flight. Doppler shifts have to be predicted and compensated for by airborne systems in order for satellite communications to function. But the compensation is not quite perfect, because satellites—particularly as they age—do not transmit signals in precisely the way airplanes have been programmed to expect. Their orbits may tilt slightly. They are also affected by temperature. These imperfections leave telltale traces. Although Doppler-shift logs had never been used before to determine the location of an airplane, Inmarsat technicians in London were able to discern a significant distortion suggesting a turn to the south at 2:40 a.m. The turn point was a bit north and west of Sumatra, the northernmost island of Indonesia. It has been assumed, at some analytical risk, that the airplane then flew straight and level for a very long while in the general direction of Antarctica, which lay beyond its range.\\n\\nAfter six hours, the Doppler data indicated a steep descent—as much as five times greater than a normal descent rate. Within a minute or two of crossing the seventh arc, the plane dived into the ocean, possibly shedding components before impact. Judging from the electronic evidence, this was not a controlled attempt at a water landing. The airplane must have fractured instantly into a million pieces. But no one knew where the impact had occurred, much less why. And no one had the slightest bit of physical evidence to confirm that the satellite interpretations were correct. Less than a week after the disappearance, The Wall Street Journal published the first report about the satellite transmissions, indicating that the airplane had most likely stayed aloft for hours after going silent. Malaysian officials eventually admitted that the account was true. The Malaysian regime was said to be one of the most corrupt in the region. It was also proving itself to be furtive, fearful, and unreliable in its investigation of the flight. Accident investigators dispatched from Europe, Australia, and the United States were shocked by the disarray they encountered. Because the Malaysians withheld what they knew, the initial sea searches were concentrated in the wrong place—the South China Sea—and found no floating debris. Had the Malaysians told the truth right away, such debris might have been found and used to identify the airplane’s approximate location; the black boxes might have been recovered. The underwater search for them ultimately centered on a narrow swath of ocean thousands of miles away. But even a narrow swath of the ocean is a big place. It took two years to find the black boxes from Air France 447, which crashed into the Atlantic on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in 2009—and the searchers had known exactly where to look.\\n\\nRead: Malaysian officials update last words spoken from MH370 The initial search of surface waters ended in April 2014, after nearly two months of futile efforts, and the focus shifted to the ocean depths, where it remains today. Blaine Gibson followed the frustration at first from a distance. He sold his mother’s house and moved to the Golden Triangle of northern Laos, where he and a business partner set about building a restaurant on the Mekong River. He joined a Facebook discussion group dedicated to the loss of MH370. It was filled with speculation, but also with news that reflected useful thinking about what could have happened to the airplane and where the main wreckage might be found. Although the Malaysians were nominally in charge of the entire investigation, they lacked the means and expertise to mount a subsea search-and-recovery effort; the Australians, as good international citizens, took the lead. The areas of the Indian Ocean that the satellite data pointed to—about 1,200 miles southwest of Perth—were so deep and unexplored that the first challenge was to map the undersea topography sufficiently to allow side-scanning sonar vehicles to be safely towed miles beneath the surface. The ocean floor was lined with ridges in a blackness where light had never penetrated. Gibson began to wonder whether, for all the strenuous underwater searching, debris from the airplane might someday simply wash up on a beach somewhere. While visiting friends on the coast of Cambodia, he asked whether they had stumbled on anything. They had not. Debris couldn’t possibly have drifted to Cambodia from the southern Indian Ocean, but until the airplane’s wreckage was found—proving that the southern Indian Ocean was indeed its grave—Gibson was determined to keep an open mind.\\n\\nIn March 2015, a one-year commemoration of MH370’s disappearance was held in Kuala Lumpur by the passengers’ next of kin. Uninvited, and largely unknown to them, Gibson decided to attend. Because he had no special knowledge to offer, his arrival raised eyebrows. People don’t know what to make of a dilettante. The commemoration took place in an outdoor space at a shopping mall, a typical event venue for Kuala Lumpur. The purpose was to grieve collectively, but also to maintain pressure on the government of Malaysia to provide explanations. Hundreds of people attended, many from China. There was a bit of music on a stage. In the background a large poster showed the silhouette of a Boeing 777, along with the words where, who, why, when, whom, how, and also impossible, unprecedented, vanished, and clueless. The principal speaker was a young Malaysian woman named Grace Subathirai Nathan, whose mother had been on the flight. Nathan is a criminal-defense lawyer specializing in death-penalty cases, of which Malaysia has many because of draconian laws. She had emerged as the most effective representative of the next of kin. She took to the stage wearing an oversize T-shirt printed with a cartoon graphic of MH370 and the exhortation search on, and then proceeded to describe her mother, the deep love she felt for her, and the difficulty of enduring her disappearance. On occasion she quietly wept, as did some in the audience, including Gibson. Afterward, he approached Nathan and asked whether she would accept a hug from a stranger. She did, and they became friends.\\n\\nGibson left the commemoration determined to help by addressing a gap he had perceived—the lack of coastal searches for floating debris. This would be his niche. He would become MH370’s private beachcomber. The official investigators, primarily Australian and Malaysian, were heavily invested in their underwater search. They would have scoffed at Gibson’s ambition, just as they would have scoffed at the prospect that on beaches hundreds of miles apart, Gibson would find pieces of the airplane.\\n\\n3. The Mother Lode The Indian Ocean washes against tens of thousands of miles of coastline, depending on how many islands you include in your count. When Blaine Gibson started looking for debris, he did not have a plan. He flew to Myanmar because he had been intending to go there anyway, then went to the coast and asked some villagers where flotsam tended to drift ashore. They directed him to several beaches, and a fisherman took him there by boat. He found some debris, but nothing that came from an airplane. He advised the villagers to be on the lookout, left his contact number, and moved on. Similarly, he visited the Maldives and the islands of Rodrigues and Mauritius without finding debris of interest. Then came July 29, 2015. About 16 months after the airplane went missing, a municipal beach-cleanup crew on the French island of Réunion came upon a torn piece of airfoil about six feet long that seemed to have just washed ashore. The foreman of the crew, a man named Johnny Bègue, realized that it might have come from an airplane, but he had no idea which one. He briefly considered making it into a memorial—setting it on an adjacent lawn and planting some flowers around it—but instead he called a local radio station with the news. A team of gendarmes showed up and took the piece away. It was quickly determined to be a part of a Boeing 777, a control surface called a flaperon that is attached to the trailing edge of the wings. Subsequent examination of serial numbers showed that it had come from MH370.\\n\\nHere was the necessary physical evidence of what had already been electronically surmised—that the flight had ended violently in the Indian Ocean, albeit somewhere still unknown and thousands of miles to the east of Réunion. The families of those aboard the airplane had to surrender any fantasies that their loved ones might still be alive. It came as a shock, no matter how rational and realistic they had been. Grace Nathan was devastated. She told me that she could barely function for weeks after the flaperon was found. Gibson flew to Réunion and found Johnny Bègue on his beach. Bègue was friendly. He showed Gibson where he had found the flaperon. Gibson poked around for other debris but without expectation, because the French government had already mounted a follow-up search to no avail. Flotsam takes a while to drift across the Indian Ocean, moving from east to west at the low southern latitudes, and a flaperon might arrive sooner than other debris because parts of it could rise above the water and act as a sail. A newspaper reporter in Réunion interviewed Gibson for a story about the visit of this independent American investigator. Gibson wore a search on T-shirt for the occasion. He then flew to Australia, where he spoke with two oceanographers—Charitha Pattiaratchi, of the University of Western Australia at Perth, and David Griffin, who worked for a government research center in Hobart and had been assigned to advise the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the lead agency in the search for MH370. Both men were experts on Indian Ocean currents and winds. Griffin in particular had spent years tracking drift buoys, and had launched an effort to model the complex drift characteristics of the flaperon during its voyage to Réunion—the hope being to backtrack and narrow the geographic scope of the undersea search. Gibson’s needs were easier to handle: He wanted to know the most likely locations for floating debris to come ashore. The answer was the northeast coast of Madagascar and, to a lesser degree, the coast of Mozambique.\\n\\nGibson opted for Mozambique because he had not been there before and could bag it as his 177th country. He chose a town called Vilanculos, because it seemed safe and had nice beaches. He got there in February 2016. As he recalls, he asked for advice from local fishermen, and was told of a sandbank called Paluma that lay beyond a reef, where fishermen would go to collect nets and buoys that washed in from the Indian Ocean. Gibson paid a boatman named Suleman to take him there. They found all sorts of junk, mostly plastic. Suleman called Gibson over. Holding up a gray triangular scrap about two feet across, he asked, “Is this 370?” The scrap had a honeycomb structure and the stenciled words no step on one surface. Gibson’s first impression was that it could not have come from a large airplane. To me he said, “So my mind was telling me it’s not from the plane, but my heart was telling me it’s from the plane. Then we had to take the boat back. And here we get into the personal thing. Two dolphins appeared and helped lead us off that sandbank—my mother’s spirit animal. When I saw those dolphins, I thought, This is from the plane.” Make of that what you will, but Gibson turned out to be right. The scrap—from a horizontal-stabilizer panel—was determined to almost certainly be from MH370. Gibson flew to the capital, Maputo, and handed the debris to the Australian consul. Then he flew to Kuala Lumpur, just in time for the second-anniversary commemoration. This time he was welcomed as a friend.\\n\\nIn June 2016, Gibson turned his attention to the remote northeastern shores of Madagascar. This turned out to be the mother lode. Gibson says he found three pieces on the first day, and another two a few days later. The following week, on a beach eight miles away, three more pieces were delivered to him. And so it has gone ever since. Word has gotten around that he will pay for MH370 debris. He says he once paid so much for a piece—$40—that an entire village went on a day-long bender. Apparently the local rum is cheap. A lot of debris washed up that had nothing to do with the airplane. But of the several dozen pieces that have been identified to date as certain or likely or suspected to have come from MH370, Gibson has been responsible for the discovery of roughly a third. Some pieces are still being investigated. Gibson’s influence has been so large that David Griffin, though grateful to him, has worried that the perceived debris pattern may now be statistically skewed toward Madagascar, perhaps at the expense of points farther north. He has given this worry a name: “The Gibson Effect.” The fact remains that, after five years, no one has yet been able to work backwards from where the debris has washed ashore and trace it to some point of origin in the southern Indian Ocean. In his insistence on maintaining an open mind, Gibson still holds out the hope of finding new debris that will explain the disappearance—charred wiring indicating a fire, for instance, or shrapnel-peppered evidence of a missile strike—although what is known about the flight’s final hours largely precludes such possibilities. What Gibson’s discovery of so many bits of debris has confirmed is that the signals analysis was correct. The airplane flew for six hours until the flight came suddenly to an end. There was no effort by someone at the controls to bring the airplane down gently. It shattered. There is still a chance, Gibson thinks, of finding the equivalent of a message in a bottle—a note of desperation scribbled by someone in his or her last moments on the doomed airplane. On the beaches, Gibson has found a few backpacks and a large number of purses, all of which have been empty. The closest he has come to finding such a note, he says, was a message written in Malay on the underside of a baseball cap. Translated, it read, “To whom it may concern. My dear friend, meet me at the guesthouse later.”\\n\\nIllustrations by La Tigre\\n\\nA—1:21 a.m., March 8, 2014: Over the South China Sea, near a navigational waypoint between Malaysia and Vietnam, MH370 drops from air-traffic-control radar and turns southwest, back across the Malay Peninsula.\\n\\n\\n\\nB—Roughly an hour later:\\n\\nAfter flying northwest above the Strait of Malacca, the airplane makes what investigators call the “final major turn” and heads south. The turn and the new course are later reconstructed from satellite data.\\n\\n\\n\\nC—April 2014:\\n\\nThe surface search is abandoned and a deep-ocean search gets under way. Analysis of satellite data had located MH370’s final electronic “handshake” along an arc.\\n\\n\\n\\nD—July 2015:\\n\\nThe first piece of debris from MH370—a flaperon—is discovered on the island of Réunion. Other confirmed or likely pieces have been found on widely dispersed beaches in the western Indian Ocean (locations in red). 4. The Conspiracies Three official investigations were launched in the wake of MH370’s disappearance. The first was the largest, most rigorous, and most expensive: the technically advanced Australian underwater-search effort, which was focused on locating the main debris in order to retrieve the airplane’s flight-data and cockpit voice recorders. It involved calculations of aircraft performance, the parsing of radar and satellite records, studies of oceanic drift, doses of statistical analysis, and the physical examination of the East African flotsam—much of which came from Blaine Gibson. It required heavy maritime operations in some of the world’s roughest seas. Assisting the effort was a collection of volunteer engineers and scientists who found one another on the internet, called themselves the Independent Group, and collaborated so effectively that the Australians took their work into account and ended up formally thanking them for their insights. In the annals of accident investigation, this had never happened before. Nonetheless, after more than three years and about $160 million, the Australian investigation closed without success. It was picked up in 2018 by an American company called Ocean Infinity, under contract with the Malaysian government on a “no-find, no-fee” basis. This search used advanced underwater-surveillance vehicles and covered a new section of the seventh arc, a section deemed most likely by the Independent Group to bring results. After a few months, it too ended in failure.\\n\\nThe second official investigation belonged to the Malaysian police, and amounted to background checks of everyone on the airplane as well as some of their friends. It is hard to know the true extent of the police discoveries, because the report that resulted from the investigation stopped short of full disclosure. The report was stamped secret and withheld even from other Malaysian investigators, but after it was leaked by someone on the inside, its inadequacies became clear. In particular, it held back on divulging all that was known about the captain, Zaharie. No one was surprised. The prime minister at the time was a nasty man named Najib Razak, who was alleged to be monumentally corrupt. The press in Malaysia was censored. Troublemakers were being picked up and made to disappear. Officials had reason for caution. They had careers to protect, and maybe their lives. It is obvious that decisions were made to not pursue certain avenues that might have reflected poorly on Malaysia Airlines or the government. The third official investigation was the accident inquiry, intended not to adjudicate liability but to find probable cause, and to be conducted according to the highest global standards by an international team. It was led by an ad hoc working group assembled by the Malaysian government, and was a mess from its inception. The police and military disdained it. Government ministers saw it as a risk. Foreign specialists who were sent to assist began retreating almost as soon as they arrived. An American expert, referring to the international aviation protocol that is supposed to govern accident inquiries, told me, “Annex 13 is tailored for accident investigations in confident democracies, but in countries like Malaysia, with insecure and autocratic bureaucracies, and with airlines that are either government-owned or seen as a matter of national prestige, it always makes for a pretty poor fit.”\\n\\nA close observer of the MH370 process said, “It became clear that the primary objective of the Malaysians was to make the subject just go away. From the start there was this instinctive bias against being open and transparent, not because they were hiding some deep, dark secret, but because they did not know where the truth really lay, and they were afraid that something might come out that would be embarrassing. Were they covering up? Yes. They were covering up for the unknown.” In the end the investigation produced a 495-page report in weak imitation of Annex 13 requirements. It was stuffed with boilerplate descriptions of 777 systems that had clearly been lifted from Boeing manuals and were of no technical value. Indeed, nothing in the report was of technical value, since Australian publications had already fully covered the relevant satellite information and ocean-drift analysis. The Malaysian report was seen as hardly more than a whitewash whose only real contribution was a frank description of the air-traffic-control failures—presumably because half of them could be blamed on the Vietnamese, and because the Malaysian controllers constituted the weakest local target, politically. The report was released in July 2018, more than four years after the event. It stated that the investigative team was unable to determine the cause of the airplane’s disappearance. The idea that a sophisticated machine, with its modern instruments and redundant communications, could simply vanish seemed beyond the realm of possibility. Such a conclusion invites continued speculation, even if it is unwarranted. The satellite data provide the best evidence of the airplane’s flight path, and are hard to argue with, but people have to have trust in numbers to accept the story they tell. All sorts of theorists have made claims, amplified by social media, that ignore the satellite data, and in some cases also the radar tracks, the aircraft systems, the air-traffic-control record, the physics of flight, and the basic contours of planetary geography. For example, a British woman who blogs under the name of Saucy Sailoress and does Tarot readings for hire was vagabonding around southern Asia with her husband and dogs in an oceangoing sailboat. She says that on the night MH370 disappeared they were in the Andaman Sea, and she spotted what looked like a cruise missile coming at her. The missile morphed into a low-flying airplane with a well-lit cockpit, bathed in a strange orange glow and trailing smoke. As it flew by she concluded that it was on a suicide mission against a Chinese naval fleet farther out to sea. She did not yet know about the disappearance of MH370, but when, a few days later, she learned of it she drew what was to her the obvious connection. Implausible, perhaps, but she gained an audience.\\n\\nAn Australian has been claiming for several years to have found MH370 by means of Google Earth, in shallow waters and intact; he has refused to disclose the location while he works on crowdfunding an expedition. On the internet you will find claims that the airplane has been found intact in the Cambodian jungle, that it was seen landing in an Indonesian river, that it flew into a time warp, that it was sucked into a black hole. One scenario has the airplane flying off to attack the American military base on Diego Garcia before getting shot down. A recent online report that Captain Zaharie had been discovered alive and was lying in a Taiwanese hospital with amnesia won sufficient acceptance that Malaysia angrily denied it. The news had come from a crudely satirical website that also reported a sexual assault on an American trekker and two Sherpas by a yeti-like creature in Nepal. A New York–based writer named Jeff Wise has hypothesized that one of the electronic systems on board the airplane may have been reprogrammed to provide false data—indicating a turn south into the Indian Ocean when in fact the airplane turned north toward Kazakhstan—in order to lead investigators astray. He calls this the “spoof” scenario, and has elaborated extensively on it, most recently in a 2019 ebook. He proposes that the Russians might have stolen the airplane to create a distraction from the annexation of Crimea, then under way. An obvious weak spot in the argument is the need to explain how, if the airplane was flown to Kazakhstan, all that wreckage ended up in the Indian Ocean. Wise’s answer is that it was planted.\\n\\nBlaine Gibson was new to social media when he started his search, and he was in for a surprise. As he recalls, the trolls emerged as soon as he found his first piece—the one labeled no step—and they multiplied afterward, particularly as the beaches of Madagascar began to bear fruit. The internet provokes emotion even in response to unremarkable events. A catastrophe taps into something toxic. Gibson was accused of exploiting the families and of being a fraud, a publicity hound, a drug addict, a Russian agent, an American agent, and at the very least a dupe. He began receiving death threats—messages on social media and phone calls to friends predicting his demise. One message said that either he would stop looking for debris or he would leave Madagascar in a coffin. Another warned that he would die of polonium poisoning. There were more. He was not prepared for this, and was incapable of shrugging it off. During the days I spent with him in Kuala Lumpur, he kept abreast of the latest attacks with the assistance of a friend in London. He said, “I once made the mistake of going on Twitter. Basically, these people are cyberterrorists. And it works. It’s effective.” He has been traumatized. In 2017, Gibson arranged a formal mechanism for the transfer of debris: He would turn over any new find to authorities in Madagascar, who would hand it to Malaysia’s honorary consul, who would pack it up and ship it to Kuala Lumpur for examination and storage. On August 24 of that year, the honorary consul was gunned down in his car by an assassin who escaped on a motorcycle and has never been found. A French-language news account alleged that the consul had a shady past; his killing may have had no connection to MH370 at all. Gibson, however, has assumed that there is a connection. A police investigation is ongoing.\\n\\nBy now he largely avoids disclosing his location or travel plans, and for similar reasons avoids using email and rarely speaks over the telephone. He likes Skype and WhatsApp for their encryption. He frequently swaps out his SIM cards. He believes he is sometimes followed and photographed. There is no arguing that Gibson is the only person who has gone out looking for pieces of MH370 on his own and found debris. But the idea that the debris is worth killing for is hard to take seriously. It would be easier to believe if the debris held clues to dark secrets and international intrigue. But the evidence—much of it now out in the open—points in a different direction.\\n\\n5. The Possibilities In truth, a lot can now be known with certainty about the fate of MH370. First, the disappearance was an intentional act. It is inconceivable that the known flight path, accompanied by radio and electronic silence, was caused by any combination of system failure and human error. Computer glitch, control-system collapse, squall lines, ice, lightning strike, bird strike, meteorite, volcanic ash, mechanical failure, sensor failure, instrument failure, radio failure, electrical failure, fire, smoke, explosive decompression, cargo explosion, pilot confusion, medical emergency, bomb, war, or act of God—none of these can explain the flight path. Second, despite theories to the contrary, control of the plane was not seized remotely from within the electrical-equipment bay, a space under the forward galley. Pages could be spent explaining why. Control was seized from within the cockpit. This happened in the 20-minute period from 1:01 a.m., when the airplane leveled at 35,000 feet, to 1:21 a.m., when it disappeared from secondary radar. During that same period, the airplane’s automatic condition-reporting system transmitted its regular 30-minute update via satellite to the airline’s maintenance department. It reported fuel level, altitude, speed, and geographic position, and indicated no anomalies. Its transmission meant that the airplane’s satellite-communication system was functioning at that moment.\\n\\nBy the time the airplane dropped from the view of secondary—transponder-enhanced—radar, it is likely, given the implausibility of two pilots acting in concert, that one of them was incapacitated or dead, or had been locked out of the cockpit. Primary-radar records—both military and civilian—later indicated that whoever was flying MH370 must have switched off the autopilot, because the turn the airplane then made to the southwest was so tight that it had to have been flown by hand. Circumstances suggest that whoever was at the controls deliberately depressurized the airplane. At about the same time, much if not all of the electrical system was deliberately shut down. The reasons for that shutdown are not known. But one of its effects was to temporarily sever the satellite link. An electrical engineer in Boulder, Colorado, named Mike Exner, who is a prominent member of the Independent Group, has studied the radar data extensively. He believes that during the turn, the airplane climbed up to 40,000 feet, which was close to its limit. During the maneuver the passengers would have experienced some g‑forces—that feeling of being suddenly pressed back into the seat. Exner believes the reason for the climb was to accelerate the effects of depressurizing the airplane, causing the rapid incapacitation and death of everyone in the cabin. The cabin occupants would have become incapacitated within a couple of minutes, lost consciousness, and gently died without any choking or gasping for air. An intentional depressurization would have been an obvious way—and probably the only way—to subdue a potentially unruly cabin in an airplane that was going to remain in flight for hours to come. In the cabin, the effect would have gone unnoticed but for the sudden appearance of the drop-down oxygen masks and perhaps the cabin crew’s use of the few portable units of similar design. None of those cabin masks was intended for more than about 15 minutes of use during emergency descents to altitudes below 13,000 feet; they would have been of no value at all cruising at 40,000 feet. The cabin occupants would have become incapacitated within a couple of minutes, lost consciousness, and gently died without any choking or gasping for air. The scene would have been dimly lit by the emergency lights, with the dead belted into their seats, their faces nestled in the worthless oxygen masks dangling on tubes from the ceiling.\\n\\nThe cockpit, by contrast, was equipped with four pressurized-oxygen masks linked to hours of supply. Whoever depressurized the airplane would have simply had to slap one on. The airplane was moving fast. On primary radar it appeared as an unidentified blip approaching the island of Penang at nearly 600 miles an hour. The mainland nearby is home to Butterworth Air Base, where a squadron of Malaysian F-18 interceptors is stationed, along with an air-defense radar—not that anyone was paying attention. According to a former official, before the accident report was released last summer, Malaysian air-force officers demanded to review and edit it. In a section called “Malaysian Military Radar,” the report provides a timeline suggesting that the air-defense radar had been actively monitored, that the military was well aware of the identity of the aircraft, and that it purposefully “did not pursue to intercept the aircraft since it was ‘friendly’ and did not pose any threat to national airspace security, integrity and sovereignty.” The question of course is why, if the military knew the airplane had turned around and was flying west, it then allowed the search to continue for days in the wrong body of water, to the east. For all its expensive equipment, the air force had failed at its job and could not bring itself to admit the fact. In an Australian television interview, the former Malaysian defense minister said, “If you’re not going to shoot it down, what’s the point in sending [an interceptor] up?” Well, for one thing, you could positively identify the airplane, which at this point was just a blip on primary radar. You could also look through the windows into the cockpit and see who was at the controls. At 1:37 a.m., MH370’s regularly scheduled 30-minute automatic condition-reporting system failed to transmit. We now know that the system had been isolated from any satellite transmission—something easily done from within the cockpit—and therefore could not send out any of its scheduled reports. At 1:52 a.m., half an hour into the diversion, MH370 passed just south of Penang Island, made a wide right turn, and headed northwest up the Strait of Malacca. As the airplane turned, the first officer’s cellphone registered with a tower below. It was a single brief connection, during which no content was transmitted. Eleven minutes later, on the assumption that MH370 was still over the South China Sea, a Malaysia Airlines dispatcher sent a text message instructing the pilots to contact Ho Chi Minh’s air-traffic-control center. The message went unanswered. All through the Strait of Malacca, the airplane continued to be hand-flown. It is presumed that everyone in the cabin was dead by this point. At 2:22 a.m., the Malaysian air-force radar picked up the last blip. The airplane was 230 miles northwest of Penang, heading northwest into the Andaman Sea and flying fast. Three minutes later, at 2:25, the airplane’s satellite box suddenly returned to life. It is likely that this occurred when the full electrical system was brought back up, and that the airplane was repressurized at the same time. When the satellite box came back on, it sent a log-on request to Inmarsat; the ground station responded, and the first linkup was accomplished. Unbeknownst to anyone in the cockpit, the relevant distance and Doppler values were recorded at the ground station, later allowing the first arc to be established. A few minutes later a dispatcher put in a phone call to the airplane. The satellite box accepted the link, but the call went unanswered. An associated Doppler value showed that the airplane had just made a wide turn to the south. To investigators, the place where this happened became known as the “final major turn.” Its location is crucial to all the efforts that have followed, but it has never quite been pinned down. Indonesian air-defense radar should have shown it, but the radar seems to have been turned off for the night. MH370 was now most likely flying on autopilot, cruising south into the night. Whoever was occupying the cockpit was active and alive. Was this a hijacking? A hijacking is the “third party” solution favored in the official report. It is the least painful explanation for anyone in authority that night. It has immense problems, however. The main one is that the cockpit door was fortified, electrically bolted, and surveilled by a video feed that the pilots could see. Also, less than two minutes passed between Zaharie’s casual “good night” to the Kuala Lumpur controller and the start of the diversion, with the attendant loss of the transponder signal. How would hijackers have known to make their move precisely during the handoff to Vietnamese air traffic control, and then gained access so quickly and smoothly that neither of the pilots had a chance to transmit a distress call? It is possible of course that the hijackers were known to the pilots—that they were invited into the cockpit—but even that does not explain the lack of a radio transmission, particularly during the hand-flown turn away from Beijing. Both of the control yokes had transmitter switches, within the merest finger reach, and some signal could have been sent in the moments before an attempted takeover. Furthermore, every one of the passengers and cabin-crew members has been investigated and cleared of suspicion by teams of Malaysian and Chinese investigators aided by the FBI. The quality of that police work is open to question, but it was thorough enough to have uncovered the identities of two Iranians who were traveling under false names with stolen passports—seeking, however, nothing more nefarious than political asylum in Germany. It is possible that stowaways—by definition unrecorded on the airplane’s manifest—had hidden in the equipment bay. If so, they would have had access to two circuit breakers that, if pulled, would have unbolted the cockpit door. But that scenario has problems, too. The bolts click loudly when they open—an unambiguous sound that would have been familiar to the pilots. The hijackers would then have had to open a galley-floor hatch from below, climb a short ladder, evade notice by the cabin crew, evade the surveillance video, and enter the cockpit before either of the pilots transmitted a distress call. It is unlikely that this could have happened, just as it is unlikely that a flight attendant held hostage could have used the door keypad to allow sudden entry without firing off a warning. Furthermore, what would the purpose be of a hijacking? Money? Politics? Publicity? An act of war? A terrorist attack? The intricate seven-hour profile of MH370’s deviation into oblivion fits none of these scenarios. And no one has claimed responsibility for the act. Anonymity is not consistent with any of these motives. 6. The Captain This leaves us with a different sort of event, a hijacking from within where no forced entry is required—by a pilot who runs amok. Reasonable people may resist the idea that a pilot would murder hundreds of innocent passengers as the collateral price of killing himself. The definitive response is that this has happened before. In 1997, a captain working for a Singaporean airline called SilkAir is believed to have disabled the black boxes of a Boeing 737 and to have plunged the airplane at supersonic speeds into a river.* In 1999, EgyptAir Flight 990 was deliberately crashed into the sea by its co-pilot off the coast of Long Island, resulting in the loss of everyone on board. In 2013, just months before MH370 disappeared, the captain of LAM Mozambique Airlines Flight 470 flew his Embraer E190 twin jet from cruising altitude into the ground, killing all 27 passengers and all six crew members. The most recent case is the Germanwings Airbus that was deliberately crashed into the French Alps on March 24, 2015, also causing the loss of everyone on board. Its co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, had waited for the pilot to use the bathroom and then locked him out. Lubitz had a record of depression and—as investigations later discovered—had made a study of MH370’s disappearance, one year earlier. From the November 2001 issue: William Langewiesche on EgyptAir 990 In the case of MH370, it is difficult to see the co-pilot as the perpetrator. He was young and optimistic, and reportedly planning to get married. He had no history of any sort of trouble, dissent, or doubts. He was not a German signing on to a life in a declining industry of budget airlines, low salaries, and even lower prestige. He was flying a glorious Boeing 777 in a country where the national airline and its pilots are still considered a pretty big deal. It is the captain, Zaharie, who raises concerns. The first warning is his portrayal in the official reports as someone beyond reproach—a good pilot and placid family man who liked to play with a flight simulator. This is the image promoted by Zaharie’s family, but it is contradicted by multiple indications of trouble that too obviously have been brushed over. The Malaysian police report held back on divulging what was known about the captain, Zaharie. No one was surprised. The police discovered aspects of Zaharie’s life that should have caused them to dig more deeply. The formal conclusions they drew were inadequate. The official account, referring to Zaharie as the PIC, or pilot in command, had this to say: The PIC’s ability to handle stress at work was reported to be good. There was no known history of apathy, anxiety, or irritability. There were no significant changes in his lifestyle, interpersonal conflict, or family stresses … There were no behavioral signs of social isolation, change of habits or interest … On studying the PIC’s behavioral pattern on the CCTV [at the airport] on the day of the flight and prior 3 flights, there were no significant behavioral changes observed. On all the CCTV recordings the appearance was similar, i.e. well-groomed and attired. The gait, posture, facial expressions and mannerisms were his normal characteristics. This was either irrelevant or at odds with what was knowable about Zaharie. The truth, as I discovered after speaking in Kuala Lumpur with people who knew him or knew about him, is that Zaharie was often lonely and sad. His wife had moved out, and was living in the family’s second house. By his own admission to friends, he spent a lot of time pacing empty rooms waiting for the days between flights to go by. He was also a romantic. He is known to have established a wistful relationship with a married woman and her three children, one of whom was disabled, and to have obsessed over two young internet models, whom he encountered on social media, and for whom he left Facebook comments that apparently did not elicit responses. Some were shyly sexual. He mentioned in one comment, for example, that one of the girls, who was wearing a robe in a posted photo, looked like she had just emerged from a shower. Zaharie seems to have become somewhat disconnected from his earlier, well-established life. He was in touch with his children, but they were grown and gone. The detachment and solitude that can accompany the use of social media—and Zaharie used social media a lot—probably did not help. There is a strong suspicion among investigators in the aviation and intelligence communities that he was clinically depressed. If Malaysia were a country where, in official circles, the truth was welcome, then the police portrait of Zaharie as a healthy and happy man would carry some weight. But Malaysia is not such a country, and the official omission of evidence to the contrary only adds to all the other evidence that Zaharie was a troubled man. Forensic examinations of Zaharie’s simulator by the FBI revealed that he experimented with a flight profile roughly matching that of MH370—a flight north around Indonesia followed by a long run to the south, ending in fuel exhaustion over the Indian Ocean. Malaysian investigators dismissed this flight profile as merely one of several hundred that the simulator had recorded. That is true, as far as it goes, which is not far enough. Victor Iannello, an engineer and entrepreneur in Roanoke, Virginia, who has become another prominent member of the Independent Group and has done extensive analysis of the simulated flight, underscores what the Malaysian investigators ignored. Of all the profiles extracted from the simulator, the one that matched MH370’s path was the only one that Zaharie did not run as a continuous flight—in other words, taking off on the simulator and letting the flight play out, hour after hour, until it reached the destination airport. Instead he advanced the flight manually in multiple stages, repeatedly jumping the flight forward and subtracting the fuel as necessary until it was gone. Iannello believes that Zaharie was responsible for the diversion. Given that there was nothing technical that Zaharie could have learned by rehearsing the act on a gamelike Microsoft consumer product, Iannello suspects that the purpose of the simulator flight may have been to leave a bread-crumb trail to say goodbye. Referring to the flight profile that MH370 would follow, Iannello said of Zaharie, “It’s as if he was simulating a simulation.” Without a note of explanation, Zaharie’s reasoning is impossible to know. But the simulator flight cannot easily be dismissed as a random coincidence. In Kuala Lumpur, I met with one of Zaharie’s lifelong friends, a fellow 777 captain whose name I have omitted because of possible repercussions for him. He too believed that Zaharie was guilty, a conclusion he had come to reluctantly. He described the mystery as a pyramid that is broad at the base and one man wide at the top, meaning that the inquiry might have begun with many possible explanations but ended up with a single one. He said, “It doesn’t make sense. It’s hard to reconcile with the man I knew. But it’s the necessary conclusion.” I asked about the need Zaharie would have had to somehow deal with his cockpit companion, First Officer Fariq Hamid. He replied, “That’s easy. Zaharie was an examiner. All he had to say was ‘Go check something in the cabin,’ and the guy would have been gone.” I asked about a motive. He had no idea. He said, “Zaharie’s marriage was bad. In the past he slept with some of the flight attendants. And so what? We all do. You’re flying all over the world with these beautiful girls in the back. But his wife knew.” He agreed that this was hardly a reason to go berserk, but thought Zaharie’s emotional state might have been a factor. Does the absence of all of this from the official report— Zaharie’s travails; the peculiar nature of the flight profile on the simulator—not to mention the technical inadequacies of the report itself, constitute a cover-up? At this point, we cannot say. We know some of what the investigators knew but chose not to reveal. There is likely more that they discovered and that we do not yet know. Which brings us back to the demise of MH370. It is easy to imagine Zaharie toward the end, strapped into an ultra-comfortable seat in the cockpit, inhabiting his cocoon in the glow of familiar instruments, knowing that there could be no return from what he had done, and feeling no need to hurry. He would long since have repressurized the airplane and warmed it to the right degree. There was the hum of the living machine, the beautiful abstractions on the flatscreen displays, the carefully considered backlighting of all the switches and circuit breakers. There was the gentle whoosh of the air rushing by. The cockpit is the deepest, most protective, most private sort of home. Around 7 a.m., the sun rose over the eastern horizon, to the airplane’s left. A few minutes later it lit the ocean far below. Had Zaharie already died in flight? He could at some point have depressurized the airplane again and brought his life to an end. This is disputed and far from certain. Indeed, there is some suspicion, from fuel-exhaustion simulations that investigators have run, that the airplane, if simply left alone, would not have dived quite as radically as the satellite data suggest that it did—a suspicion, in other words, that someone was at the controls at the end, actively helping to crash the airplane. Either way, somewhere along the seventh arc, after the engines failed from lack of fuel, the airplane entered a vicious spiral dive with descent rates that ultimately may have exceeded 15,000 feet a minute. We know from that descent rate, as well as from Blaine Gibson’s shattered debris, that the airplane disintegrated into confetti when it hit the water. 7. The Truth For now the official investigations have petered out. The Australians have done what they could. The Chinese want to move on and are censoring any news that might inflame the passions of the families. The French are off in France, rehashing the satellite data. The Malaysians just wish the whole subject would go away. I attended an event in the administrative city of Putrajaya last fall, where Grace Nathan and Gibson stood in front of the cameras with the transport minister, Anthony Loke. The minister formally accepted five new pieces of debris collected over the summer. He was miserable to the point of being angry. He barely spoke, and took no questions from the press. Nathan was seething at the minister’s attitude. That night, over dinner, she insisted that the government should not be allowed to walk away so easily. She said, “They didn’t follow protocol. They didn’t follow procedure. I think it’s appalling. More could have been done. As a result of the inaction of the air force—of all of the parties involved in the first hour who didn’t follow protocol—we are stuck like this now. Every one of them breached protocol one time, multiple times. Every single person who had some form of responsibility at the time did not do what he was supposed to do. To varying degrees of severity. Maybe in isolation some might not seem so bad, but when you look at it as a whole, every one of them contributed 100 percent to the fact that the airplane has not been found.” And every one of them was a government employee. Nathan had hopes that Ocean Infinity, which had recently found a missing Argentine submarine, would return to the search, again on a no-find, no-fee basis. The company had suggested the possibility of doing so earlier that week. But the government of Malaysia would have to sign the contract. Because of the political culture, Nathan worried that it might not—as so far has proved true.

No, it did not catch on fire yet stay in the air for all that time. No, it did not become a “ghost flight” able to navigate and switch its systems off and then back on. No, it was not shot down after long consideration by nefarious national powers who lingered on its tail before pulling the trigger. And no, it is not somewhere in the South China Sea, nor is it sitting intact in some camouflaged hangar in Central Asia. The one thing all of these explanations have in common is that they contradict the authentic information investigators do possess. That aside, finding the wreckage and the two black boxes may accomplish little. The cockpit voice recorder is a self-erasing two-hour loop, and is likely to contain only the sounds of the final alarms going off, unless whoever was at the controls was still alive and in a mood to provide explanations for posterity. The other black box, the flight-data recorder, will provide information about the functioning of the airplane throughout the entire flight, but it will not reveal any relevant system failure, because no such failure can explain what occurred. At best it will answer some relatively unimportant questions, such as when exactly the airplane was depressurized and how long it remained so, or how exactly the satellite box was powered down and then powered back up. The denizens of the internet would be obsessed, but that is hardly an event to look forward to. The important answers probably don’t lie in the ocean but on land, in Malaysia. That should be the focus moving forward. Unless they are as incompetent as the air force and air traffic control, the Malaysian police know more than they have dared to say. The riddle may not be deep. That is the frustration here. The answers may well lie close at hand, but they are more difficult to retrieve than any black box.

              " 'When Catherine Jacobson first heard about the promise of cannabis, she was at wits’ end. Her 3-year-old son, Ben, had suffered from epileptic seizures since he was 3 months old, a result of a brain malformation called polymicrogyria. Over the years, Jacobson and her husband, Aaron, have tried giving him at least 16 different drugs, but none provided lasting relief. They lived with the grim prognosis that their son — whose cognitive abilities never advanced beyond those of a 1-year-old — would likely continue to endure seizures until the cumulative brain injuries led to his death.\\n\\nIn early 2012, when Jacobson learned about cannabis at a conference organized by the Epilepsy Therapy Project, she felt a flicker of hope. The meeting, in downtown San Francisco, was unlike others she had attended, which were usually geared toward lab scientists and not directly focused on helping patients. This gathering aimed to get new treatments into patients’ hands as quickly as possible. Attendees weren’t just scientists and people from the pharmaceutical industry. They also included, on one day of the event, families of patients with epilepsy.\\n\\nThe tip came from a father named Jason David, with whom Jacobson began talking by chance outside a presentation hall. He wasn’t a presenter or even very interested in the goings-on at the conference. He had mostly lost faith in conventional medicine during his own family’s ordeal. But he claimed to have successfully treated his son’s seizures with a cannabis extract, and now he was trying to spread the word to anyone who would listen.\\n\\nThe idea to try cannabis extract came to David after he found out that the federal government held a patent on cannabidiol, a molecule derived from the cannabis plant that is commonly referred to as CBD. Unlike the better-known marijuana molecule delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, CBD isn’t psychoactive; it doesn’t get users high. But in the late 1990s, scientists at the National Institutes of Health discovered that it could produce remarkable medicinal effects. In test tubes, the molecule shielded neurons from oxidative stress, a damaging process common in many neurological disorders, including epilepsy.\\n\\nJacobson had a Ph.D. in neuroscience. She had started her postdoctoral research at the University of California, San Francisco, by studying how cancer cells metastasize and spread, but after Ben was born, she moved to Stanford and switched her focus to epilepsy — a shift that compounded her anguish. She often wept in the parking lot before heading into the lab, overwhelmed by dread at the prospect of deliberately causing epilepsy in rodents. “I couldn’t watch animals seize all day and then watch Ben seize all night,” she told me. “It was just too much.”\\n\\nAfter meeting David and reading through the small body of published work on CBD, Jacobson changed postdoctoral directions once again, from primary research to the study of this community of parents who were treating their epileptic children with cannabis extracts. In reality, she was preparing to join it herself. One small, double-blind study particularly caught her attention. In 1980, scientists in Brazil treated eight epileptic patients with CBD and eight patients with sugar pills as a placebo. For half the group that received CBD, the seizures almost completely disappeared; another three experienced a reduction in the intensity of their seizures. Only one person in the placebo group got better.\\n\\nThe epilepsy drugs that had been approved to date, none of which had helped Ben much, typically targeted the same few ion channels and receptors on the surface of neurons. But CBD worked on different and still somewhat mysterious pathways. If she could find a suitable CBD extract, Jacobson thought, she might have a truly new class of drug for Ben. The other experimental drugs and devices she had heard about at epilepsy conferences were under development, unapproved by the F.D.A. and thus largely unavailable. But medical marijuana had been legal in California since 1996, so CBD was theoretically accessible right away.\\n\\n[Read more on why CBD is everywhere.]\\n\\nSeven years later, cannabidiol is everywhere. We are bombarded by a dizzying variety of CBD-infused products: beers, gummies, chocolates and marshmallows; lotions to rub on aching joints; oils to swallow; vaginal suppositories for “soothing,” in one company’s words, “the area that needs it most.” CVS and Walgreens each recently announced plans to sell CBD products in certain states. Jason David now sells a cannabis extract called Jayden’s Juice, named for his son — one of several extracts on the market, including Haleigh’s Hope and Charlotte’s Web, that are named after children who are said to have benefited from being treated with CBD.\\n\\nMany of these products are vague about what exactly CBD can do. (The F.D.A. prohibits unproven health claims.) Yet promises abound on the internet, where numerous articles and testimonials suggest that CBD can effectively treat not just epilepsy but also anxiety, pain, sleeplessness, Crohn’s disease, arthritis and even anger. A confluence of factors has led to this strange moment. Plenty of legitimate, if still inconclusive, research is being done on CBD. Many scientists are truly excited about it. The laws governing cannabis and its chemical components have loosened up. And the anecdotes that have emerged from what Elizabeth Thiele, an epileptologist at Harvard, calls the “vernacular” cannabis movement have lent emotional force to the claims made for CBD.\\n\\nAmid the current deluge of products, it now seems almost quaint that, back in 2012, after deciding to try treating Ben with CBD, Jacobson couldn’t actually locate the stuff. Other parents of epileptic children were using D.I.Y. techniques to treat their children: tinctures; cannabis-infused butter in baked goods; crushed cannabis buds in capsule form; even cannabis suppositories. Some reported positive results. Over the years, Jacobson has had many of these products tested at labs; almost invariably they contained very little or no CBD and too much THC. It has psychoactive effects, and there wasn’t much science suggesting THC could treat seizures.\\n\\nCatherine Jacobson and her son, Ben, at home in Mill Valley, Calif. His seizures have left him with very little ability to communicate, but one of his main ways of showing affection is hugging his mother’s head close to his chest. September Dawn Bottoms for The New York Times\\n\\nJacobson describes her family’s existence as akin to living under the threat of terrorism. Ben’s seizures could strike at any time. He was at high risk of what epileptologists call Sudep, or sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. “I would have done anything to save Ben,” Jacobson told me. And so one day in 2012 she found herself driving her black S.U.V. to a rundown Oakland neighborhood, past a police car, to purchase a kilo of what she had been told was CBD-rich cannabis.\\n\\nIn the early 1960s, a Bulgarian-born Israeli chemist named Raphael Mechoulam asked a simple question: How does marijuana make you high? The biochemistry of major psychoactive molecules from other recreationally used drugs, like cocaine and opium, was already understood. But scientists still didn’t know how cannabis worked. Mechoulam was the first scientist to map the chemical structure of both cannabidiol and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Two decades later, Allyn Howlett, a scientist then at St. Louis University Medical School, used a radioactive THC equivalent to trace where cannabinoids ended up in the brain and discovered what she would later call CB1 receptors. They were subsequently found in the kidneys, lungs and liver, too. White blood cells of the immune system, the gut and the spleen also have another type of cannabinoid receptor, known as CB2.\\n\\nThere is a long history of scientists gaining insight into human physiology by studying how plants interact with our bodies. Poppy flowers and the opium derived from them led to the discovery of the body’s native opioid receptors, which help regulate pain, stress responses and more. Nicotine, a stimulant found in tobacco, long used by Native Americans, taught scientists about the existence of our own nicotinic receptors, which influence neuronal excitement.\\n\\nWhy plants produce molecules that seem perfectly designed to manipulate human biochemical circuitry is a mystery. It could be a kind of molecular coincidence. But many plants, including cannabis, might make these molecules to defend themselves from other organisms. Modern industrial agriculture employs a whole class of pesticides based on nicotine — the neonicotinoids — meant to repel insects by over-exciting their nervous systems. Cannabinoids display antibacterial, antifungal and insecticidal properties as well. Their ability to engage our native cannabinoid receptors may be a result of millions of years of biochemical warfare directed at would-be grazers: insects and other creatures that happen to share biochemical signaling pathways with humans. If plants target the cannabinoid receptors of other organisms to protect themselves, it follows that whatever signals those receptors evolved to receive have to be vital for these animals’ physiological health. Otherwise, why interfere with them?\\n\\nMechoulam concluded that our bodies must produce their own cannabinoids — endogenous molecules that, like the native opioids and nicotinelike molecules our bodies also make, engage the cannabinoid receptors throughout the human body. In 1992, he identified the first one. Mechoulam, who is often called the godfather of cannabis research — he was a senior scientist on the Brazilian CBD epilepsy trial that inspired Jacobson — and his colleagues christened it “anandamide,” after the Sanskrit word for “supreme joy.” They suspected that the molecule played a role in the formation of emotions.\\n\\nThe native network of cannabinoid receptors and transmitters described by Howlett and Mechoulam is now known as the endocannabinoid system. It’s central to homeostatic regulation, that is, how the body maintains, and returns to, its baseline state after being disturbed. If a person is injured, for example, native cannabinoids increase, presumably in order to resolve the inflammation and other damage signals associated with injury. They also increase after strenuous exercise, another stressor, and some scientists have argued that they, not the better-known endorphins, are really responsible for the pleasant postexercise feeling known as runner’s high.\\n\\nEndocannabinoids help regulate immune activity, appetite and memory formation, among many other functions. (Heavy marijuana use is associated with memory deficits, possibly because THC short-circuits the formation of memories.) “Perhaps no other signaling system discovered during the past 15 years is raising as many expectations for the development of new therapeutic drugs,” Vincenzo Di Marzo, an endocannabinoid researcher at the National Research Council in Naples, Italy, wrote in 2008, in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. But realizing such medical benefits has proved trickier than once imagined.\\n\\nWhen scientists at the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis (now Sanofi) understood that THC could whet a user’s appetite, they created a weight-loss drug that blocked CB1 receptors, hoping to suppress appetite. Rimonabant was first released in Europe in 2006. Two years later, regulators pulled it from the marketplace because of its severe side effects, including depression and suicidal behavior. The episode seems to exemplify endocannabinoids’ importance to our sense of well-being and the difficulty of manipulating them therapeutically. Attempts to increase native cannabinoids with synthetic drugs have fared no better. In 2016, French scientists halted a study of a drug designed to boost endocannabinoids. For reasons that remain unclear, six patients who took the medicine, meant to treat pain, were hospitalized. One died.\\n\\nAnd yet, for millenniums people have used cannabis itself with relatively few side effects. (These can include dry mouth, lethargy and paranoia.) THC hits CB1 and CB2 receptors, but how CBD works is less clear. It seems to interact with multiple systems: increasing the quantity of native cannabinoids in the human body; binding with serotonin receptors, part of the “feel good” molecular machinery targeted by conventional S.S.R.I.s; and stimulating GABA receptors, responsible for calming the nervous system. With more than 65 cellular targets, CBD may provide a kind of full-body massage at the molecular level.\\n\\nThis biochemical promiscuity is one reason CBD seems so medically promising, according to Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist at Mount Sinai, in New York. Modern neuroscience often tries to target one pathway or receptor, Hurd told me; that approach is easier to study scientifically, but it may not address what are often network-wide problems. “The brain is about a symphony,” she says. And CBD, she suspects, can “bring the entire symphony into harmony.”\\n\\nVarious products that have been advertised as containing CBD. Jamie Chung for The New York Times. Prop styling by Anna Surbatovich.\\n\\nCannabis has been used medicinally for thousands of years in Asia, where it was probably first domesticated before traveling to, among other places, Africa. It was almost certainly introduced multiple times to the Americas, first from Africa to South America through the slave trade — in Brazil it’s still known by an African name, diamba — but also to the Caribbean. Indian indentured laborers probably brought it to Jamaica, where it’s called by an ancient Indian name, ganja.\\n\\nWhite Americans also had some history of using cannabis in tinctures. In the early 19th century, an Irish doctor working in India, William Brooke O’Shaughnessy, had observed that cannabis was used extensively in Indian medicine. He began experimenting and found it quite efficacious not only for infantile seizures but also rheumatism and spasms caused by tetanus. O’Shaughnessy usually gets the credit for introducing the plant to the English-speaking world, but while he popularized its use in Britain, he was not the first European to bring it back to Europe. Garcia Da Orta, a Portuguese physician, had, after living in India, written about cannabis as medicine in the 1500s.\\n\\nAfter O’Shaughnessy published his treatises on the plant, its use spread rapidly among physicians. By the late 19th century, cannabis was an important component of British and American physicians’ pharmacopoeia. (Researchers suspect that these older cannabis cultivars, and the tinctures made from them, probably contained much less THC and much more CBD than modern varieties.) Of course, hemp, a variety of cannabis bred not for consumption but for the fiber that goes into ropes and sails, among other things, had been an important crop in Europe and the Americas for centuries. George Washington grew it. The English word “canvas” derives from the Greek kannabis.\\n\\nBut in the late 19th century, our ancient relationship with this plant began to fray. In 1930, Harry Anslinger, a former official at the Bureau of Prohibition, assumed a new job running the Bureau of Narcotics. The Mexican Revolution that began in 1910 had led to waves of immigrants crossing into the United States. Whereas many Americans took their cannabis orally in the form of tinctures, the new arrivals smoked it, a custom that was also moving north from New Orleans and other port cities from which African-Americans were beginning their own migration.\\n\\nAnslinger disdained Mexican-Americans and African-Americans. He loathed jazz. Modern scholars argue that his demonizing cannabis both justified his position and provided a way for him to gain legal leverage over peoples he despised. The high cost paid by people of color, once he had begun what we now call “the war on drugs,” may not have been an incidental byproduct of his efforts but an unstated goal from the start. His protestations still echo today. Cannabis made people crazy, violent and prone to criminal behavior, Anslinger said.\\n\\nYet when 30 American Medical Association members were surveyed, starting in 1929, 29 disagreed with claims about the dangers posed by cannabis. One said the proposals to outlaw it were “absolute rot.” But the hysteria Anslinger helped stir up worked politically. In 1937, Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act. High taxes made cannabis much more expensive and difficult to obtain decades before President Nixon — scientists of his era disagreed with him, too, about marijuana’s supposed dangers — signed the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. A plant that people had used medicinally for thousands of years was now driven underground.\\n\\nJacobson’s dealer in Oakland seemed to be selling harder stuff as well, which made her very nervous. But her impression was that he was having a difficult time selling this particular product — kilos of California-grown cannabis — precisely because it wouldn’t get anyone very high. With her black-market stash in hand, Jacobson entered what she calls her R.& D. phase. As suspected, the cannabis she had acquired illegally in Oakland was high in CBD and low in THC. She set up a lab in her garage — and then proceeded to fail miserably, for months, to extract anything of much use. Only under the tutelage of two University of California, Davis, scientists did she make progress. The technique she developed required heating cannabis plants in ethanol to extract the cannabinoids. Next, a machine that created a vacuum sucked the green-tinted liquid through a tube filled with carbon powder. The molecules in the extract moved through the powder at different speeds, depending on their weight and other characteristics, yielding different “fractions” that she could test for CBD and THC content. Then she heated the resulting green solution until the alcohol evaporated, leaving a green paste. It took her about six months to perfect the process. Finally, nearly a year after starting, she had a cannabis extract that was high in CBD and lacked measurable THC.\\n\\nBen improved somewhat after taking it, but it was another boy with severe epilepsy, 11-year-old Sam Vogelstein, who responded most significantly. Jacobson and Sam’s mother, Evelyn Nussenbaum, had met and become close friends as together they sought a safe and reliable source of CBD for their children. But now Jacobson felt a different sort of pressure. Making the medicine was difficult. Despite all that she had learned, some batches of her extract were unusable. And who knew if the source material she was buying illegally would remain available? If this was to be their sons’ medicine, Jacobson wanted a pharmaceutical-grade product that she could always obtain.\\n\\nAcross the Atlantic, Geoffrey Guy, the founder of a company called GW Pharmaceuticals, had successfully brought one cannabis-derived medicine, called Sativex, to market in Britain and other European countries. The first such medication permitted by a government, it was approved to treat the symptoms of spasticity (as well as pain) caused by multiple sclerosis, a progressive autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. It contained both CBD and THC. Guy was intrigued when, through a mutual acquaintance, a California family seeking CBD to treat epilepsy reached out to him — Evelyn Nussenbaum and her son Sam.\\n\\nGuy agreed to treat Sam. Jacobson had her extract analyzed and the results sent to Guy. In December 2012, Sam and Nussenbaum flew to London for two weeks to try a purified CBD drug that Guy had created just for him. He started with a small dose and, as it was gradually increased, his seizures faded. Before his trip, Sam was taking three conventional medications and still having dozens of seizures daily. But after he reached the highest daily dose of CBD — 250 milligrams — his seizures stopped almost entirely for a week. He became more articulate and coherent than he had been since he was 5, when his condition took a turn for the worse. He rode a zip line in Hyde Park, took the subway and did other things that Nussenbaum had always avoided for fear that he would seize and hurt himself. Nussenbaum describes that week as “Twilight Zone weird,” as if she had entered a parallel dimension.\\n\\n[Read about how China is cashing in on the cannabis boom.]\\n\\nAfter he returned to the United States, it was six months before Sam could take Guy’s extract again. Medical marijuana is illegal under federal law — its designation as a Schedule 1 drug means it is considered to have a high potential for abuse and without any known medical application — but Sam gained access to Guy’s extract through the F.D.A.’s compassionate-use program, which makes still-unapproved drugs available to patients with serious conditions. (In 2015 Sam’s father, Fred Vogelstein, a journalist, detailed Sam’s story in Wired magazine. In 2010, he also wrote in this magazine about using a ketogenic diet, since discontinued, to control Sam’s epilepsy.) With a petition from a U.C.S.F. epileptologist, Roberta Cilio, who was the doctor for both boys, Ben also received the medicine through the F.D.A.’s compassionate-use program. It helped, Jacobson thought, particularly with the most severe fits, which caused him to lose consciousness. But he was by no means seizure-free.\\n\\nJacobson and Nussenbaum knew many other families struggling with epilepsy. They were aware of the suffering and desperation of those who belonged to this “club that no one wanted to join,” as Nussenbaum puts it. Many parents lacked the resources and connections they had. Everyone should have access to the drug that had so helped Sam, they thought. But that meant the F.D.A. would have to approve CBD for epilepsy. For that to happen, real trials had to take place. And given the fraught political history of cannabis in the United States and the skepticism they would most likely face, Jacobson knew she would need top epilepsy experts to conduct those trials.\\n\\nThe D.E.A.’s classification of cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug, alongside heroin, peyote, ecstasy and LSD, has made it difficult for American scientists to study. Much of the research into its therapeutic potential comes from other countries, including Brazil. In the 1970s, Antonio Zuardi, a neuroscientist at the University of São Paulo, began looking into how cannabinoids affect mental states. Large quantities of THC could cause anxiety and paranoia in volunteers, he discovered, but CBD could attenuate the anxiety-provoking and psychoticlike effects of THC. Later studies by Zuardi and his colleagues showed that a large dose of CBD, when given to volunteers who feared public speaking — that is, who suffer from social anxiety — blunted the flight-or-fight response, measured by increases in heart rate, blood pressure and skin conductivity, prompted by having to address others. These were small studies, and the amount of CBD involved, which was 600 milligrams in the social-phobia study, is greater than what users might consume these days in some CBD gummies, for example, but relieving anxiety is nonetheless one of the most widely reported reasons people use CBD.\\n\\nCBD may also have antipsychotic properties. In susceptible individuals, its sister cannabinoid THC can, in high doses, induce psychotic symptoms, and heavy marijuana use early in life has been linked to an increased risk of developing psychotic disorders, possibly because it alters brain development. But just as Zuardi discovered that CBD can blunt anxiety, scientists at King’s College London have found evidence that CBD can lessen the psychosis-producing effects of THC and maybe help treat schizophrenia, a disorder whose main symptom is psychosis. The scientists are now testing CBD as a prophylactic to prevent schizophrenia from even emerging.\\n\\nMany of those who develop schizophrenia first pass through a “prodromal” phase. They suffer from delusions, but they’re still aware that these experiences aren’t real and often seek psychiatric help. A single 600-milligram dose of CBD given to these patients, scientists at Kings College London have found, can partially normalize regions of the brain that have been shown in fMRI visualizations to become dysfunctional during schizophrenic episodes.\\n\\nA follow-up study will prophylactically treat a large group of these patients thought to be teetering on the edge of psychosis. Current schizophrenia treatments merely attempt to manage the disorder once it has already emerged. A medicine that slows or prevents the disease from taking root altogether, almost like a vaccine, would address a huge unmet need. “If it works, it will be a revolution,” José Crippa, a neuroscientist at the University of São Paulo who is involved in the project, told me.\\n\\nIt’s reasonable to ask why the CBD naturally present in cannabis doesn’t protect recreational users from the negative effects of THC. In older varieties, where the CBD-to-THC ratio was closer to 1-to-1, maybe it did. But today’s strains typically contain about three times as much THC as the cannabis smoked recreationally even as recently as the 1990s, while CBD concentrations have fallen by about half in the same period, according to a recent University of Mississippi study on black-market marijuana. And precisely because the proportions between the two cannabinoids have become so skewed — the ratio of THC to CBD has risen to 80 to 1 from 14 to 1 in two decades — lots of modern cannabis is potentially much more toxic for the brain, says Hurd, who is the director of the Addiction Institute at Mount Sinai.\\n\\nSome years ago, Hurd discovered that THC could, as opponents of marijuana legalization have long maintained, prompt heroin-seeking behavior in rodents, acting as a proverbial “gateway drug.” But she also found that CBD reduced drug-seeking behavior, which led her to change the focus of her work. Now she studies how CBD could help opioid addicts kick the habit.\\n\\nHurd’s research, replicated by others, indicates that CBD might help recovering opioid addicts avoid relapse, perhaps the greatest challenge they face. She’s not sure why but suspects that by reducing anxiety and craving — major triggers of relapse — CBD helps patients stay the course. And because it’s not habit-forming, like other anti-anxiety medications, CBD might be a badly needed new weapon with which to fight an epidemic that claims more than 130 lives daily in the United States.\\n\\nTHC may also have therapeutic uses, particularly in treating the pain that often puts people on a path leading toward opioid addiction. Several studies have found that cancer patients need fewer opioid painkillers if they’re also using cannabis. And opioid-related deaths have declined in states that legalized medical cannabis, suggesting that people who have access to less-addictive options for pain management may not be as likely to become hooked on opioids.\\n\\nOther possible applications of plant-derived cannabinoids could be just as groundbreaking. Scientists at New York University are studying CBD as a possible treatment for autism spectrum disorders. Spanish researchers are testing both THC and CBD on an aggressive brain cancer called glioblastoma. Israeli scientists have found that CBD can lessen the incidence of graft-versus-host disease in bone-marrow transplant patients, presumably because the cannabinoid calms the immune system and deters it from attacking the patient.\\n\\nHow could one family of molecules help so many maladies? The most obvious response is that they might not; all this research is preliminary and might not pan out. But scientists often propose a counter-explanation: Many chronic disorders, even though they seem distinct, are characterized by dysfunction in the same few pathways. Inflammation and oxidative stress, for example, occur in schizophrenia, metabolic disorders, heart disease and other ailments. The therapeutic magic of CBD and, in some cases, THC — and maybe some of the more than 100 other cannabinoids in cannabis — may come from the ways that, by tweaking the endocannabinoid system, they push the body away from disease toward the unruffled state scientists call homeostasis.\\n\\nThere are other examples of a single drug being able to help meliorate a variety of conditions. We know aspirin as a treatment for fever and headache, for example, but in low doses it is also used to reduce the risks of stroke, heart attack and pre-eclampsia in pregnant mothers; it even figures as an adjunct treatment for schizophrenia. Aspirin has its own downsides — an elevated risk of bleeding, for instance — but like CBD, its broad utility may be partly explained by its anti-inflammatory effects. Like CBD, aspirin is derived from a plant. The active ingredient in aspirin, salicylate, was first extracted from willow bark and was a folk remedy for thousands of years before scientists finally made a pill from it in the late 19th century. Folk medicine, for all its associations with old wives’ tales, has yielded important medical discoveries in the past, and it may well do so again.\\n\\nIn early 2013, just a few weeks after Sam Vogelstein returned from Britain, Catherine Jacobson organized a brainstorming session at N.Y.U., which included Geoffrey Guy, epilepsy researchers and a consultant with a D.E.A. background, in order to figure out how to make F.D.A.-sanctioned trials happen. What followed the meeting surpassed Jacobson’s expectations. The F.D.A. first expanded the ability of doctors to prescribe CBD and then fast-tracked the approval process. The neurologists who ran the trials included Orrin Devinsky from N.Y.U., Elizabeth Thiele from Harvard and Eric Marsh from the University of Pennsylvania.\\n\\nIn June 2018, just five years after that meeting — an instant in drug-development time — the F.D.A. approved GW Pharmaceutical’s CBD extract as a treatment for two rare forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. And three months later the D.E.A. rescheduled this first CBD drug (but not THC) to Schedule 5, meaning it was now considered to have low potential for abuse.\\n\\nThe drug, called Epidiolex, is not the first cannabis-related drug on the market. Marinol, used to suppress nausea and stimulate appetite, contains THC. But Epidiolex is the first drug that contains only CBD and the first one derived directly from the cannabis plant itself. (The THC in Marinol is synthetic.) As a new class of medicine, Thiele told me, it’s important for the reasons Jacobson recognized years ago: It hits different pathways than do currently available epilepsy drugs, thereby expanding the available treatments for difficult-to-treat childhood epilepsies.\\n\\nEpidiolex is also noteworthy for its unusual history. Drugs are typically developed in the lab and go through trials before reaching patients. But in the case of Epidiolex, two mothers of epileptic children experimented on their own sons and then helped push a version of what they discovered into the F.D.A. pipeline. “In the modern era, it’s certainly the most striking example of a drug that has gone from patient use to drug development,” Ken Mackie, a neuroscientist at Indiana University, told me. And it’s unlikely to be the last such example. Because so many people already use cannabis and think it helps, patients might be, in effect, pioneering new uses through self-experimentation.\\n\\nThis trend concerns many physicians, who worry that patients may be deluding themselves, but some scientists interested in cannabinoids have begun to look to “vernacular” applications for clues about what to study formally. Users, meanwhile, look to the published literature as Jacobson did for guidance on how to use cannabinoids. The end result is that cannabis science and vernacular cannabis use exist in an uneasy symbiosis. “It’s this completely unprecedented situation,” Jacobson says. “I don’t think there’s another product out there that’s a wellness drug, a pharmaceutical drug for severe disease and a recreational drug.”\\n\\nCBD is generally considered safe, even at the high doses tested so far — and the quantities in chocolates, teas and other edibles tend to be far below the concentrations tested experimentally. But given that cannabis regulations vary from state to state, scientists and patient advocates worry that consumers may not be getting what they think they’re getting.\\n\\nStill, many who have direct experience with CBD, including a few scientists, do not think it should be available only by prescription. They point out that long before the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, which made marijuana illegal, people used the plant medicinally. Cannabis should not only take its place as an F.D.A.-approved drug, they contend. It should also reclaim its role as a folk remedy.\\n\\nFrom left: Margarita Sanchez, Ben’s nanny, Ben and Catherine at home. Ben wears a strap to prevent him from falling when he has his seizures. September Dawn Bottoms for The New York Times\\n\\nIf there is a Patient Zero in the vernacular cannabis movement, that person is a girl in Colorado named Charlotte Figi. Her seizures began at 3 months, as Ben Jacobson’s had. Doctors diagnosed Dravet syndrome, in her case caused by a spontaneous genetic mutation. By the time she was 5, she was wheelchair-bound, receiving sustenance through a feeding tube, seizing about 350 times per week, and on several occasions she had to be shocked back to life after her heart stopped. Doctors once recommended a medically induced coma just so her body could rest.\\n\\nIn 2011, as a last resort, Charlotte’s mother, Paige, gave her a CBD-rich extract, acquired from a local grower, via feeding tube. (Medical cannabis has been legal in Colorado since 2000.) The seizures almost entirely disappeared. Word of this success spread through the network of medical-marijuana professionals, and early in 2013, someone called on behalf of the CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta. Gupta, who is a neurosurgeon, had previously argued against the legalization of medical cannabis, but he now wanted to do a show on it. After much discussion, Paige Figi and Joel Stanley, the Boulder-based cannabis grower who had produced the extract for Charlotte, decided to invite Gupta to tell their story. If it came from a skeptic of his standing, people might actually believe it.\\n\\nGupta visited the Figi home, watched old videos of Charlotte seizing, looked at family photos, and saw the Charlotte before him as a playful little girl of 6. At one point, Paige Figi told me, Gupta, who has daughters of his own, requested that the cameras be turned off, and cried.\\n\\nHe came away a convert, convinced of medical cannabis’s effectiveness. And the show, which aired in August 2013, catapulted Charlotte’s story to national prominence and Figi into a new, unexpected phase in her life. Within days of Gupta’s report, people began showing up at the Figi family’s door, desperate parents of epileptic children from elsewhere in the country who picked up and moved to Colorado in the hope of acquiring medical cannabis. Figi fed them. Some stayed a few nights. One family ended up living with them for a year. A community began to coalesce in Colorado Springs, made up of epileptic children and their families.\\n\\nAround the same time, Figi, Stanley and Heather Jackson, another mother whose epileptic son had benefited from CBD, founded a nonprofit called Realm of Caring. It helped families relocate to Colorado and offered them advice on how to negotiate the state’s medical- cannabis environment.\\n\\nThis was also a period of some tension and confusion. Stanley couldn’t keep up with the surge in demand. He kept long waiting lists of hopeful parents. Westword, a Denver-based paper, published a story in which parents — some of whom didn’t seem to realize that Realm of Caring did not provide cannabis products — vented about feeling ignored. One father, whose very sick son had benefited from Stanley’s cannabis extract but then suddenly died, wondered obliquely if he had contributed to his child’s death. (Stanley’s company responded with a statement saying that elements of the Westword story were inaccurate.)\\n\\nFigi and Stanley eventually left Realm of Caring to avoid conflicts of interest. In 2017, the F.D.A. sent a letter to Stanley and Realm of Caring warning them to stop making medical claims about treating specific disorders. (Both say they updated their websites.) Today, Stanley is the chairman of Charlotte’s Web, a company named after Charlotte Figi. Last fall, the business went public in Canada; it projects more than $120 million in sales this year, more than triple its 2017 sales.\\n\\nWhere Jacobson and Nussenbaum saw their role as helping a cannabis-derived drug get F.D.A. approval, Figi focused on legislation, becoming a kind of CBD ambassador. She testified before State Legislatures and helped draft a 2017 House bill that, if it hadn’t died, would have legalized CBD nationally.\\n\\nFigi, who says she switched her party affiliation from Republican to Democrat after Donald Trump was elected president, even considered running for elected office and making access to CBD part of her platform. Given CBD’s many therapeutic benefits, she reasons, the cannabinoid should be legally available for use without prescription. And that access should not depend on whether recreational cannabis is also legal. “I’m just trying to help these kids,” she told me this past winter. “We can do something for them now. Why hold them hostage?”\\n\\nOne reason some physicians look askance at the vernacular cannabis movement is that it can, in its sometimes quasi-religious devotion to the plant, seem almost cultlike. Kristen Park, an epileptologist at Children’s Hospital in Colorado, told me that after Gupta’s CNN story aired, patients from around the country seeking medical cannabis inundated the hospital. She had no data at that point on its efficacy and did not recommend it. The Epidiolex trials have provided some evidence of effectiveness, Park told me, but she still frets over the phenomenon. Sometimes parents of patients refuse established epilepsy treatments in favor of cannabis products, she says, because these are perceived as somehow natural and thus superior to standard medicines. Other parents insist cannabis is helping their children when, in her view, it clearly isn’t — and they refuse to stop using it when they should move on to other treatments. “Because of all the hype, people somehow think this is a cure-all and a treatment that will fix everything,” she told me. What’s lost on many, she says, is that even if CBD helps, it’s still just another drug, and no drug works for everyone all the time.\\n\\nNor are most drugs completely free of side effects. In the standard drug-approval process, observed side effects are noted on the packaging. If new ones show up after F.D.A. approval, they can be added later. As Ken Mackie, from Indiana University, told me, there’s no mechanism to do this in the vernacular movement, no central repository of interactions and side effects.\\n\\nCBD has known side effects. Elizabeth Thiele, the epileptologist at Harvard, says that some children, for reasons that aren’t clear, undergo mood changes on some nonprescription CBD oils. (These issues might be caused by different cannabinoids or terpenes, another type of biologically active molecule produced by plants.) CBD can also interfere with how quickly the body breaks down other medications.\\n\\nThe greatest concern, however, and one I heard repeatedly from parents and physicians, is quality control. In 2015, the F.D.A. found that many CBD-labeled products actually contained very little CBD. It sent out a flurry of letters warning companies not to make medical claims. Two years later, a study published in JAMA documented that, in 84 products sold online, 26 percent had less CBD than advertised and 43 percent had more. And the cannabis plant can absorb toxic substances like heavy metals or pesticides as well as carry infective agents. In 2017, a California man undergoing chemotherapy, whose immune system was weakened, died from a fungal infection that his physicians suspect he acquired from the cannabis he smoked to ease his symptoms.\\n\\nLast year, California legalized recreational marijuana and phased in a series of stringent quality controls, including tests for various microbes, pesticides and heavy metals. Customers who buy cannabis from licensed California dispensaries can now be reasonably confident that they’re getting what they think they’re buying and that it’s safe to consume. This goes for some other states as well.\\n\\nEven as a wave of entrepreneurs has founded companies already worth millions in what’s often called “the green rush” — the explosion of cannabis-related business — many people of color remain incarcerated for marijuana-related crimes. Some states and cities are moving to correct this. For example, last year Denver’s mayor announced that more than 10,000 convictions for low-level marijuana crimes, going back to 2001, would be eligible for expungement.\\n\\nAt the same time, confusion about the federal legality of CBD-related commerce remains widespread. The 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp, a low-THC, potentially high-CBD variety of cannabis, meaning that CBD from hemp is now theoretically legal nationwide. But there’s a wrinkle: The F.D.A. says that because CBD is also an approved drug (Epidiolex), the cannabinoid can’t be considered, as some argue it should be, a nutraceutical or dietary supplement. The companies that ship CBD products across state lines — an activity subject to F.D.A. enforcement — may be doing so illegally. Yet even though the F.D.A. has the authority to clamp down on CBD-related products and interstate commerce, it can choose not to do so. F.D.A. enforcement action depends on, among other things, available resources and the perceived threat to public health. (An F.D.A. spokesman declined to comment.)\\n\\nJ. Michael Bostwick, a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn., who has written about cannabis, calls the hodgepodge of conflicting rules regarding cannabis “idiotic.” He told me that even physicians willing to oversee patient cannabis use, who live in states where it’s legal, can be reluctant to do so because it remains illegal under federal law. A doctor’s license to practice medicine comes from the state, but because the license that allows doctors to prescribe medicine is federal, involvement with cannabis could lead to revocation of that license. “There’s a lack of clarity about what playing field we’re on,” Bostwick says.\\n\\nOne obvious solution to the uncertainties around legality, quality and safety of CBD products would be to force all CBD into the F.D.A. drug-approval pipeline, making it a prescription drug only. Somewhat surprisingly, Catherine Jacobson does not want that to happen. Her thinking on this issue has evolved, she told me. Early on, she thought all medical cannabis products should go through the F.D.A.’s approval process. But she realized that her primary concern, quality, could be assured without this expensive, time-consuming undertaking. In Germany, for instance, doctors have been able to prescribe cannabis since 2017, and patients get a pharmaceutical-grade product, because a federal agency oversees the medical-marijuana industry.\\n\\nJacobson, who lives in Mill Valley, Calif., now works remotely for a Canadian-based company that has also, she thinks, solved the quality problem. She’s vice president of regulatory-and-medical affairs for Tilray, which produces medical-grade cannabis products and flowers and ships them wherever they’re federally legal (and so not to the United States).\\n\\nWhat about the uncertainties over whether CBD works for a given illness? Jacobson didn’t necessarily see the lack of evidence of effectiveness as a problem. When it comes to diseases like intractable epilepsy, she said, doctors often do their own experimenting. They try standard treatments first, but when those fail, as they did in Ben and Sam’s cases, they turn to drugs that might not be approved for epilepsy or even for children. Some of these drugs might cause severe side effects, including fits of rage or sedation so extreme that, as one mother described it to me, “the light goes out” in a child’s eyes.\\n\\nA bottle of Tilray’s C100, developed for treating seizures. Jamie Chung for The New York Times\\n\\nJacobson and other parents I spoke with argue that in difficult medical cases, doctors are already tinkering with potentially toxic drugs, so why can’t they — the parents or the patients — experiment with a less-toxic product? Why can’t everyone? Scientists could search for signals on what to study in this sea of self-experimentation. Realm of Caring, still run by Heather Jackson, is already doing this in partnership with academic researchers, sharing data from a 55,000-person registry that includes information on what people are using cannabis for and what side effects and benefits they see.\\n\\nOne scientist is doing something similar with herself as a subject. In 2017, Diana Martinez, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, found out she had breast cancer and started chemotherapy with taxane, a class of drug known to cause nerve damage. Martinez began to hear ringing in her ears, feel pins and needles in her hands and lose feeling in her lower limbs. Eventually she could barely swallow, started to fall while walking and ended up concussed. In up to 80 percent of women who use taxane, these symptoms persist. Martinez decided that even if the drug helped her beat the cancer, the symptoms, which were likely to get worse, were unendurable. Over her family’s objections, she quit the chemo.\\n\\nThen a colleague reminded her that she had always wanted to study CBD for nerve pain. Why not try it herself? Martinez ordered CBD extract from a place in Colorado that seemed reputable — Charlotte’s Web, it turned out. After about six weeks on the oil, the ringing in her ears disappeared and the other symptoms began to fade. “I could swallow,” she told me. “I could walk down the street, type on a computer. It was gone. It seemed fairly miraculous. It still does.” She completed the chemo, this time with fewer side effects. Martinez, inspired by her own experience, has since started a trial with her colleague, a neurobiologist at Columbia named Margaret Haney, that will target taxane-induced neuropathy in breast-cancer patients with a pill containing both THC and CBD. The cannabinoids may work better together for some conditions, especially when pain is a factor. (Jacobson’s continued behind-the-scenes influence is evident here as well. Tilray created the formulation for Martinez’s trials.) If it helps, the cannabinoids might save lives not because they cure cancer — although others are studying that possibility as well — but because they might assist women in completing otherwise intolerable courses of chemo.\\n\\nAnd the only reason she’s pursuing this line of inquiry, Martinez points out, is that a quality, CBD-rich hemp extract was readily available when she needed it. “I’m grateful for Charlotte’s Web,” she told me. Prospective users need to do their homework and research product quality, but “when people want to take CBD,” she added, “I’m like, ‘Go for it.’ ”\\n\\nCBD is not always an unqualified success, even in the best-known case studies. For Sam Vogelstein, the inspiration behind Epidiolex, it helped control his seizures for years, limiting them to around six per day. But in the fall of 2015, Sam began suffering from a new type of seizure. These were more severe, causing him to fall to the floor writhing, which hadn’t occurred in the past. “You instantly understand why people used to say that people who have epilepsy are possessed by the devil,” Fred, Sam’s father, told me, “like some external force has taken control of this person.”\\n\\nHigher doses of Epidiolex didn’t help, so Sam’s doctor, the neurologist Roberta Cilio, recommended an anti-seizure drug called Depakote. He had taken it before, without benefit, but this time, in combination with Epidiolex, it worked wonders: Sam has been completely seizure free for more than three and a half years. He’s a tall, lanky 17-year-old who likes to fence, run and engages in “normal aggravating boy teenager stuff,” his father says — and “cause for celebration,” both parents say.\\n\\nBen Jacobson’s condition is more ambiguous. In an effort to stop the seizures, doctors surgically removed half of Ben’s parietal lobe in 2015, but the procedure didn’t mitigate the epilepsy. His doctor, Cilio, didn’t think the Epidiolex was aiding him, either, and recommended he stop taking it. Jacobson, who like many mothers of epileptic children keeps a detailed diary about seizure activity, disagreed. By her count, the number of Ben’s seizures had declined by 40 percent while on Epidiolex, particularly the severe grand mal seizures that caused him to stop breathing.\\n\\nThis disagreement between doctor and mother prompted Jacobson to find a new neurologist who, she told me, took one look at Ben and told her to do whatever she felt might help. Except for a few breaks, Ben, who’s now 10 and can’t walk unaided, has remained on Epidiolex, but his prognosis isn’t great. “He’s still going downhill,” Jacobson told me. “His life expectancy is short enough that we don’t like to think about it.”\\n\\nCharlotte Figi, now 12, continues to be almost entirely seizure-free. She’s developmentally delayed, Paige Figi told me. And she suffers from osteoporosis caused, Figi thinks, by the high doses of steroids she took to control seizures at a young age. But she is otherwise a happy, playful girl, Figi says. And what Figi discovered about CBD on Charlotte’s behalf came in handy for Charlotte’s fraternal twin sister, Chase.\\n\\nTwo years ago, Chase, who until then had exhibited no problems, began to have seizures out of the blue. Figi didn’t even bother with allopathic drugs this time. She turned straight to the Charlotte’s Web CBD extract, and the seizures stopped. “If I hadn’t done this,” Figi says — that is, experiment with CBD extracts on Charlotte — “Charlotte would be dead. And Chase would now be starting all those drugs.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, as the science inches forward, CBD has become a pop-culture phenomenon. Kim Kardashian recently hosted a CBD-themed baby shower. In April, Carl’s Jr. tested a CBD-infused burger in Colorado. Some scientists are concerned by how far the CBD craze has moved beyond the science. But Staci Gruber, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, does not think the two are necessarily in conflict. This might seem odd, given her work. She has found that recreational users, particularly those who begin using cannabis earlier in life, exhibit some cognitive difficulties and altered brain structure and function.\\n\\nIn 2014, Gruber started the Marijuana Investigations for Neuroscientific Discovery, or MIND, program to examine the effects of medical cannabis, and so far, she has found exactly the opposite in people who use cannabis as medicine. Their cognitive function appears to improve over time and preliminary evidence suggests that, after initiation of medical-cannabis treatment, their brain activity begins to normalize. Although Gruber is not certain what accounts for the contrasting effects, she has several theories. Seeking a euphoric high, recreational users often gravitate toward products higher in THC. Medical patients, meanwhile, want to control symptoms and may thus seek whole-plant products that not only contain more CBD than what recreational users typically encounter but also other potentially healthful cannabinoids. Medical users tend to be older, too, and some evidence suggests that THC is less toxic to older brains than younger and may in some cases benefit older brains.\\n\\nGruber has likewise observed that medical cannabis patients tend to reduce their use of conventional medications over time, which might itself be beneficial to brain structure and function. Whatever the explanation, Gruber believes greater scientific engagement with the CBD phenomenon is as important as more careful regulation. “People have been using cannabis forever,” she told me. “The question now is, How do we as scientists catch up?”',\n",

Others find themselves necessarily losing or gaining weight in order to play a specific role or character, but finding a healthy balance is far from easy. This article will look at some of the most amazing body transformations celebrities have been through over recent years and what they believe caused the weight gain in the first place, as well as what helped them to shed the extra pounds. Crash diets and weight-loss supplements are all part of the process, but maintaining a healthy weight really comes down to hard work and commitment. Find inspiration for your own weight-loss journey amongst these candid tales of those stars we know and love. Whether you’re 30 pounds overweight or 100, these celebrities offer some great tips for losing those pounds and rediscovering your true self, on the outside as well as the inside. Roseanne Barr The multi-talented comedienne turned actress, screenwriter, and politician, Roseanne Barr underwent surgery to help her get her weight under control. It wasn’t all easy, though, and maintaining her svelte physique has required an innovative approach. Sometimes, we just need a little push to get going. The star has been very public about her weight-loss struggles. Sometime in the ’90s, Roseanne apparently hit 350 pounds. That gave her the push she needed to started taking it seriously to lose weight. She had gastric bypass surgery in 1998 got her on the right track. She also had a tummy tuck at some point, which helped her journey even further. Smiling, Barr explains that her new diet is “radical and revolutionary. It’s where you eat less and move more…”. After her gastric bypass, Barr lost 200 pounds but only maintained that weight loss by taking up a more rigorous exercise regime which means she’s looking pretty hot on the newly rebooted series of Roseanne.\\n\\nKirstie Alley If there’s one celebrity whose weight has been a constant roller coaster, it’s Alley. From her early days in Cheers to her first diet success with Jenny Craig, Alley has enjoyed a stunning figure over the years, but in 2009, she ballooned to a robust 230 pounds. Being on the screen can be tough for many celebrities and it does seem that for Alley that was the case. She kept bouncing back and forth between her initial weight and being smaller until she became almost hopeless. But everything changed in 2009. The star has tried many weight loss avenues, including Jenny Craig, but that didn’t work either! Dancing with the Stars has proved to be her salvation and the actress lost 60 pounds prior to the show and another 30 pounds during filming. That alone makes her a winner, even if she only made it to the runner-up for her dancing. Today, her fans couldn’t be prouder of her perseverance and the fact that with some fight, she eventually achieved her goal.\\n\\nEd Sheeran While he was never obese, a healthier lifestyle certainly seems to agree with the popular singer. Ed Sheeran is one of the biggest pop stars in the world. The singer began recording music in 2004 and decided to independently release his first compilation of work, Spinning Man. It seems like it’s thanks to his many chart-topping singles, that Ed Sheeran got to the conclusion that fame gave him a reason to change. Sheeran claims he’s never dieted and that his slimmer figure is purely the result of removing alcohol from his lifestyle. t’s impressive that his body responded so positively and quickly. Sure, it might sound simple enough, but we’re not sure how many people Ed will get jumping on his bandwagon. While it may not be as big a transformation as some of the other celebrities in this article, his new look can only make him even more popular. Whether it’s truly down to cutting out the beers, or optimum nutrition played a part too, Sheeran’s not saying.\\n\\nSarah Ferguson Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson is a reference for elegance, beauty and success in many places. She has shared in the past that she started comfort eating when she was 12 years old and has been beset with weight issues ever since… until now. So many people can relate to her as binge and comfort eating a real thing and can have some serious consequences in a person’s well-being. The writer and public speaker said it got to a point where she couldn’t bear to look at herself. She thought to herself: “Enough is enough”. I was 190 pounds a year ago and I was miserable. You look at the top of the mountain, you think you’re never going to get there.” By, with a strict regime of exercise and healthy food, Fergie made it and looks fantastic for her efforts.\\n\\nDawn French Never one to keep quiet regardless of the subject, actress Dawn French, has been outspoken about her weight over the years. We have to say that we are so grateful for celebs who have shared their struggles with the public, especially when it comes to weigh-loss. People struggle with their weight-loss journeys all over the world, and hearing it from people we look up to makes things much more reachable. At the age of 60, French is looking better than ever, the result of, she says, “… tiny joyless low-cal eating and lots more walking….” French was inspired to lose weight after being told the recovery time after a hysterectomy would be a lot shorter if she was slimmer. Although she’s pleased with her new look, she also jokes, “I liked the old Dawn, I may go there again…”\\n\\nPink Pink is one of those celebs who has always managed to rock any look she went for but was left wondering what to do after two pregnancies. Conscious of wanting to have a healthy pregnancy, Pink allowed herself to indulge just a little during the early months before giving birth to her daughter, Willow. A craving for cheesecake and key lime pie didn’t help matters and, before she knew it, she had 55 excess pounds to shed. These women have the media constantly commenting on their bodies and policing how fast they can bounce back from that baby weight. So, pregnancy can become a really tough challenge for many women, especially celeb women. With the help of a personal trainer or too, Pink’s achieved her goal and says she’s now fitter than ever. In the past, Pink has overcome a drug addiction as well, which just proves what a strong person she is.\\n\\nTimothy Spall The English actor, Timothy Spall, is probably best remembered for his role of in the Harry Potter movies. Spall was spellbinding as the chubby, manipulative Peter Pettigrew, but has left the plump look far behind for his next role in Electric Dreams. Of course, having plump cheeks and dumpy build meant Timothy fit right in when he was cast as Peter Pettigrew in the Harry Potter films. He played the part perfectly and we wouldn’t have it any other way really. However, when the films and the shooting ended, the actor now had a reason to change. He wasn’t particularly happy with his weight and had some concerns about how that could affect his health. Spall says he’s battled with his weight throughout his life, largely because, he says, “I was a glutton. I loved food. I still do.” The transformation to Spall’s appearance is so dramatic, some people struggled to recognize him at the Venice Film Festival last year.\\n\\nMissy Elliott It was only when a medical professional warned her of the potential dangers of her weight gain that Elliott committed herself to slim down. It seems like this is a common warning sign for many people. It’s way too easy to let ourselves go when we keep getting heavier and heavier, but sometimes, a health scare changes everything. After removing all junk food from her diet and committing to regular hours in the gym, the singer looks happier as well as slimmer. Having been recently diagnosed with Graves’ disease, Elliott says this isn’t the reason for her leaner figure, “’I’m 30 pounds lighter because I’ve been exercising,’ she reveals. ‘My thyroid is functioning, so I haven’t had to take medication in about nine months. She is now healthier than ever and we feel so inspired by her journey. Another reason to admire the amazing rapper.\\n\\nRebel Wilson As famous for her weight as her impressive voice and on-screen presence, Wilson looks like a different person these days. After reprising her role of Fat Amy in the three Pitch Perfect movies, Wilson has dedicated herself to exercise to slim down her figure. It’s hard to get out of a role that was so focused on the fact that she was big, and to owning a different identity. But that’s exactly what Rebel Wilson has been working on for months now. One day she simply decided to change her lifestyle and in many ways to change her whole life. She got pretty tired of the bullying and the constant remarks towards her weight. While she looks and feels great now, Wilson says her weight helped her get noticed, “I walked into my agent’s office for the first time, they … said, ‘Wow, we have nobody on our books like you’. And they signed me on my second day here”.\\n\\nMiley Cyrus While obesity has never been a concern for this pop princess, she’s had a few moments when her weight has got a little out of control. Given the pressures of the celebrity lifestyle, it’s hardly surprising, but Cyrus has bounced back each time, partly thanks to her passion for Pilates. Regular gym sessions also help, along with her gluten-free diet. Whatever her secret is, she’s certainly maintaining a lithe physique these days – just like the next star in this article.\\n\\nAmerica Ferrera While a firm believer in the benefits of eating breakfast every morning, Ferrera has had to curb a few other cravings to drop the unnecessary extra weight that accrued during the filming of Ugly Betty. Putting her weight gain down to stress, the star decided to start working out and swapped junk food for fruit and vegetables, with some dietary supplements thrown in to speed things along. While still holding onto a few feminine curves, she looks a lot better for her efforts.\\n\\nEminem After dangerously overdosing on sleeping pills, Eminem took up running to stimulate the production of natural endorphins that would help him sleep. The other benefit of his new fitness regime was that it helped him to drop some of the 230 pounds he was carrying around. The rap star started running 17 miles a day, burning off around 2,000 calories daily. As a result, he quickly returned to his more familiar, Slim Shady appearance, weighing in at just 149 pounds.\\n\\nTyra Banks Although we often hold models up as slim icons epitomizing the perfect body, they have to work just as hard as anyone else to maintain their trim appearance. After years of modeling, when Tyra Banks decided to finally retire, the weight started to accumulate and there were plenty of people eager to take a shot at her as a result. In the end, Banks lost weight the natural way with exercise and a healthy diet, spurred on by her health rather than her critics, she says.\\n\\nDrew Barrymore After her split from ex-husband Will Kopelman, actress Drew Barrymore was under a lot of stress which ended up in her gaining a little more weight than she would have liked. To look the part for her role as a flesh-eating zombie in the comedy-horror series, Santa Clarita Diet, Barrymore decided some weight loss was in order. Dropping the pizzas and other fast foods from her diet and focusing on optimum nutrition has certainly made a difference and the actress is looking stunning.\\n\\nIChaz Bono Cher’s son may have opted for surgery to change his gender, but he hated the idea of going under the knife to change his shape. After hitting the tabloids over his gender reassignment, Bono was back in the public eye over his weight when he appeared on Dancing With the Stars. He took it all in his stride, though, and used the dancing as a way to lose weight, backing it up with a workout regime and a reduced calorie diet.\\n\\nNicole Richie When you’re in the public eye from a young age, it can be difficult to ignore the criticisms that come with such exposure. Richie felt she needed to slim down her figure but then went too far in the other direction and found herself the focus of numerous eating disorder rumors. Since then, the fashion designer has found a balance and looks like the superstar she’s always been. With two children and a host of professional commitments, Richie needs to keep trim simply to keep up with her fast-paced lifestyle.\\n\\nKate Winslet Losing weight after having a baby isn’t easy for anyone and this beautiful actress had work hard to drop that baby fat. Some intense cardiovascular workouts coupled with a balanced diet saw her regaining her previously willowy figure. Winslet is not one to count the pounds, however, and hasn’t been on a scale in 13 years which just goes to show, you don’t need scales to achieve the perfect body. Winslet dress size might have varied a bit over the years, but always manages to look sexy.\\n\\nGuy Sebastian In an effort to get a body worthy of the cover of Men’s Health Australia, the singer decided on a ketogenic diet. This controversial eating plan reduces carbohydrates and increases protein intake to jumpstart the body into a state of ketosis, during which body fat provides the majority of the energy required. While not recommended for all, it certainly paid dividends for Sebastian who turned from flab to fab in just eight weeks. Sebastian said he struggled with criticisms about his appearance so launched himself in a new healthier lifestyle.\\n\\nRaven Symone For someone who started their acting career at just two years old, being in the public eye constantly took its toll. Symone is best remembered for her role in the sitcom, The Cosby Show, but struggled to control her weight as a result of stress and having been taught not to waste food. By the time she was 18, she weighed around 180 pounds. These days, the slender actress has found a way to curb those unhealthy eating habits by focusing on portion size.\\n\\nCarrie Fisher To make her comeback in the seventh movie in the Star Wars series, the actress famous for her performance as Princess Leia, decided she needed to drop a few pounds. Her mental health issues combined with her drug addiction had had a negative effect on her body, so she got a personal trainer to help her out. Fisher’s natural approach to losing weight saw her drop 30 pounds within the first few weeks. Sadly, Fisher passed away after having a heart attack on a flight between London and Los Angeles.\\n\\nJonah Hill Known for his chubby appearance as much as his brilliant comic timing, Hill has admitted that his real weakness when it comes to his weight is beer. “It’s so annoying because when I don’t drink beer, I get really really thin,” the 21 Jump Street star confessed. “Then when I drink beer, I get a little bigger,” Hill said that he lost most of his weight the old-fashioned way, although he wished there was a magic pill he could attribute it to, it’s actually mainly due to dieting.\\n\\nKim Kardashia The curvy reality TV star gained some extra weight during her second pregnancy and was determined to lose it prior to a magazine photo shoot. At the time, she said, “I want to feel sexy again, I want to feel good about myself”. In addition to a very strict Atkins diet, Kardashian threw herself into a rigorous workout regime. Fortunately for her, she loves to work out, but, she said, “…so much of it is how you eat. I had to really stay focused”. Her dedication has certainly paid off.\\n\\nMila Kunis For her role as a professional ballerina in the Oscar-winning movie, Black Swan, Kunis had to commit herself to a serious weight-loss strategy. Losing 20 pounds when you’re already quite slim is no mean feat but the experience has changed the actress’s perspective on weight forever. Kunis now believes anyone can lose weight, “I’m a huge foodie, I love food. But when people say, ‘I can’t lose weight’, no no no, you can. Your body can do everything and anything, you just have to want to do it”.\\n\\nOprah Winfrey Over the years, the chat show host has had some serious weight problems and insecurities about her appearance. Back in 1999, Winfrey hit 237 pounds and decided enough was enough. Rather than splashing out on a personal trainer, however, she joined the Weight Watchers program last year lost an impressive 40 pounds to achieve a leaner appearance. Winfrey says she refuses to accept herself as she is if she’s over 200 pounds because she knows the damage it’s doing to her health and the pressure it’s putting on her heart.\\n\\nAlec Baldwin When the respected actor was diagnosed as pre-diabetic, he agreed to let his new wife, Hilaria, help him find a healthier balance in terms of his food intake and his exercise regime. Years of irregular meals and high sugar intake were taking their toll, but Baldwin managed to completely change both his diet and his relationship with food. Together, the couple now eat healthy meals and have cut out a lot of sugar to enable Baldwin’s body to rebalance. He’s certainly looking pretty debonair as a result.\\n\\nForest Whitaker At 6ft 2, this award-winning actor is a big guy and known for his massive capacity as an actor as well.

Meanwhile, a couple of years ago, Whitaker’s wife, Keisha, sparked concerns that she was somewhat underweight, but the couple seem to have leveled out their weight loss since then.\\n\\nSeth Rogen Like Jonah Hill, Rogen was known as the amusing chubby guy, but not anymore. These days, the Superbad star looks like he could be gracing the cover of Men’s Health with his chiseled cheekbones and muscular physique. In preparation for his role in Green Hornet, Rogen embarked on the 5-factor weight loss strategy, combining five small meals a day with a fat-burning exercise plan. Rogan lost around 30 pounds in just 10 weeks and looks like he’ll keep his new trim figure for some years to come.\\n\\nJohn Goodman The Roseanne star has never been small, but when his weight stumbled over 400 pounds, he decided enough was enough. Although he managed to shed 200 pounds fairly quickly, Goodman’s not convinced he’ll manage to keep it off, but he’s doing a good job so far.

After losing 80 pounds, she certainly looks healthy.\\n\\nMatthew McConaughey This talented actor has undergone some serious body transformations in the name of acting, most notably for his role in the Dallas Buyers Club.

Kimmel’s approach has certainly been unconventional, and the TV host regularly starves himself for a couple of days each week, eating just 500 calories in a day, while indulging in more calorific meals for the other five days. Although not recommended by everyone, the diet is proving effective for Rimmel who is now managing to maintain a healthy weight of 182 pounds, 20 pounds less than he was at his heaviest.\\n\\nJames Corden The popular late-night TV host has many talents but admits controlling his eating habits isn’t one of them.

Once hovering around 315 pounds, Cordon is determined to maintain his new, slimmer figure.\\n\\nMischa Barton Actress Mischa Barton found herself caught up in the celebrity world of partying which soon became more than she could cope with.

Her battles aren’t over yet, but she’s certainly looking healthier and seems to be getting her life back on track.\\n\\nAnna Gunn The Breaking Bad star was never obese, but medication for an ailment she was battling with didn’t do anything for her figure, leaving her open to criticism about her weight. The actress decided to tackle the problem head-on and is now looking decidedly slim.

She certainly proved her fitness when she scared off an intruder at her home last month!\\n\\nChris Sullivan The star of the NBC series, This is Us, has never been particularly overweight due to his commitment to healthy eating but many fans of the show truly believed he was that big in real life.

After a heart attack in 2012, O’Donnell felt she had no choice and ended up losing 175 pounds thanks to the surgery. She admits she would fool herself into thinking she wasn’t that large, “I used to buy stretch pants size 11, 12. I’d stretch them into a 20.” It looks like those days are behind her.\\n\\nMama June It’s been a long journey for the star of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. She went under the knife a year or so ago when she was a size 18. With the surgery and lots of hard work, she’s now slimmed down to an impressive size 4. While she won’t consider surgery again, she will keep working at her weight, saying, “People think that I’m going to gain the weight back. But hello, I’ve almost been at this [weight] for a year and a half and I’m not gaining”.\\n\\nGraham Elliot Being a celebrity chef means you’re around food all the time, making it really difficult if you want to shed a few pounds.

It’s an uphill battle but one she seems to be winning.\\n\\nJoseph R Gannascoli Along with gambling and drinking, the Sopranos star has also had to overcome some serious weight problems.

In a recent interview, the actress admitted, “It may be the best thing I’ve ever done”.\\n\\nHolly Madison Unlike those people who decide they need to lose everything as quickly as possible, the former Playboy model is committed to taking her time losing her baby weight.

Poof! There I am. Thin and ready for a chat”. Rhimes embarked on a low-carb diet and regular exercise because she wanted to be a healthier mum and we’re sure her kids are proud of what she’s achieved.\\n\\nNicole Sullivan Like Holly Madison, the King Of Queens star has relied on a meal delivery service to keep on the straight and narrow. After having a baby, the actress gained a few extra pounds but decided to tackle the problem the traditional way, by adopting a lower calorie intake and a more active lifestyle. Although she says the process was difficult, with her weight-loss project taking over her life, she’s made it, in the end, shedding an impressive 35 pounds. Sullivan is now a spokesperson for Jenny Craig Weight Management Programme.\\n\\nValerie Bertinelli Scales can be useful in helping people achieve their ideal weight, but, for some, they can be counterproductive. According to the star Hot in Cleveland, finding a way to be comfortable in your own body isn’t all about numbers. “I’m finally starting to realize, it is what’s in my heart that matters most, no matter what that stupid number on the scale tells me.” After gaining around 175 pounds, Bertinelli changed her attitude to food, increasing her vegetable intake and embarking on a fat-burning workout program.\\n\\nJoJo The teenage singer started trying to lose weight after her music producers told her it was essential for her future success.

JoJo now admits it was the least healthy thing she’s ever done and that the experience, “messed with her psychologically”.\\n\\nZach Galifianakis A lot of guys tend to pile on the pounds due to their alcohol intake, rather than their food calories.

Delicious but bad for you”.\\n\\nKhloe Kardashian Taller than her petite siblings, it hasn’t been easy for Khloe to keep up with the Kardashians.

But when Joseph Antonio Cartagena’s good friend, Big Pun, died of a weight-related heart attack, it was the wake-up call he needed. Without bothering with surgery, Fat Joe has lost 100 pounds the natural way, although he admits to cheating from time to time.

              " 'Could colonizing Mars be a lucrative or potentially profitable venture? originally appeared on Quora: the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights.\\n\\nAnswer by Robert Walker, Author of articles about Mars and colonization, on Quora:\\n\\nCould colonizing Mars be a lucrative or potentially profitable venture? Actually I’ve written a chapter in my Case for Moon First about just this. It’s not easy to find much detail for Mars. There’s just the eight page section “Interplanetary Commerce” in Robert Zubrin’s “The Case for Mars”, while books on Lunar settlement and colonization devote many chapters to the topic and there are many published papers also on the commercial value of the Moon.\\n\\nAccording to Elon Musk, there is only one way to make a Mars colony profitable, and that’s through licensing of intellectual property - inventions and other intellectual creations. This idea originates with Robert Zubrin who also suggested that a Mars colony could make a profit by selling deuterium. Mars colonization enthusiasts have suggested various other ways a colony might be made profitable, in online forums.\\n\\nI’ve said before that we should continue with planetary protection of Mars for a fair bit longer and that we shouldn’t just drop it because we want to send humans there. After all, if there is native indigenous microbial life on the planet, that would be one of the biggest discoveries in biology ever, especially if based on a different biochemistry. It might also be vulnerable to Earth life. Some early form of life could be especially vulnerable, such as the RNA-Isbased cells of the RNA world hypothesis, potentially tiny because they don’t use either DNA or proteins. For more on this see my One example of what we might find on Mars…\\n\\nWe shouldn’t prioritize sending humans to Mars, it seems to me, if there is any chance that we can destroy the possibility of such a major discovery in biology by introducing Earth microbes. Then there are many other reasons to be cautious about introducing Earth life until we know what it will do to the planet and know if doing that is beneficial or harmful to whatever is there, and indeed to our future selves and descendants. The problem here is that it is a single interconnected system with the Martian dust storms able to spread microbial spores throughout the planet. We are nowhere near the level of understanding needed to make such a decision about an entire planet, at present, in my view.\\n\\nBut this is relevant whether or not we send humans to the Mars surface. If there is anything of great commercial value on Mars then either.\\n\\nYou mine it telerobotically or robotically; humans remain in orbit around Mars and nobody visits the surface. Instead, they live in orbital colonies or on its moons, and control robot-like avatars on the surface. (For more on this, see my To Explore Mars With Likes Of Occulus Rift & Virtuix Omni …\\n\\nhumans remain in orbit around Mars and nobody visits the surface. Instead, they live in orbital colonies or on its moons, and control robot-like avatars on the surface. (For more on this, see my Or you mine it with humans on the surface.\\n\\nElon Musk has said clearly, several times that he doesn\\'t think there will be anything material from Mars that would be worth transporting back to Earth.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be economical to mine things on Mars and then transport them back to Earth because the transport costs would overwhelm the value of whatever you mined, but there will likely be a lot of mining on Mars that\\'s useful for a Mars base, but it\\'s unlikely to be transferred back to Earth. I think the economic exchange between a Mars base and Earth would be mostly in the form of intellectual property\" Elon Musk interview on the future of energy and transport - and more quotes like this from him. Robert Zubrin covers this in more detail: \"Another alternative is that Mars could pay for itself by transporting back ideas. Just as the labor shortage prevalent in colonial and 19th century America drove the creation of Yankee Ingenuity\\'s flood of inventions, so the conditions of extreme labor shortage combined with a technological culture and the unacceptability of impractical legislative constraints against innovation will tend to drive Martian ingenuity to produce wave after wave of invention in energy production, automation and robotics, biotechnology, and other areas. These inventions, licensed on Earth, could finance Mars even as they revolutionize and advance terrestrial living standards as forcefully as 19th Century American invention changed Europe and ultimately the rest of the world as well.\"\\n\\nElon Musk is skeptical about space mining generally thinking it probably won\\'t be possible to export from the asteroids - \"I\\'m not convinced there\\'s a case for taking something, say, platinum, that is found in an asteroid and bringing it back to Earth.\" Of course many think that this will be possible. Myself I just don\\'t know, I\\'ve heard the arguments on both sides and remain on the fence here.\\n\\nAnyway Elon Musk doesn\\'t go into any more detail about the case for or against material exports. Robert Zubrin however has discussed this in a paper \"The Economic Viability of Mars Colonization \" in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society from 1995, and later on in the Interplanetary Commerce section of Case for Mars. He first outlines the need for exports to make a Mars colony viable:\\n\\n\"A frequent objection raised against scenarios for the human settlement and terraforming of Mars is that while such projects may be technologically feasible, there is no possible way that they can be paid for. On the surface, the arguments given supporting this position appear to many to be cogent, in that Mars is distant, difficult to access, possesses a hostile environment and has no apparent resources of economic value to export. These arguments appear to be ironclad, yet it must be pointed out that they were also presented in the past as convincing reasons for the utter impracticality of the European settlement of North America and Australia.\" ...\"While the Exploration and Base building phases can and probably must be carried out on the basis of outright government funding, during the Settlement phase economics comes to the fore. That is, while a Mars base of even a few hundred people can potentially be supported out of pocket by governmental expenditures, a Martian society of hundreds of thousands clearly cannot be. To be viable, a real Martian civilization must be either completely autarchic (very unlikely until the far future) or be able to produce some kind of export that allows it to pay for the imports it requires.\" ...\"Mars is the best target for colonization in the solar system because it has by far the greatest potential for self-sufficiency. Nevertheless, even with optimistic extrapolation of robotic manufacturing techniques, Mars will not have the division of labor required to make it fully self-sufficient until its population numbers in the millions. It will thus for a long time be necessary, and forever desirable, for Mars to be able to pay for import of specialized manufactured goods from Earth. These goods can be fairly limited in mass, as only small portions (by weight) of even very high-tech goods are actually complex. Nevertheless, these smaller sophisticated items will have to be paid for, and their cost will be greatly increased by the high costs of Earth-launch and interplanetary transport. What can Mars possibly export back to Earth in return?\" (emphasis mine)\\n\\nSo according to his ideas, the Mars colony is supported on the basis of outright government funding for the early stages of exploration and base building. He thinks that in these early stages you need something over and above ISRU (In Situ Resource Uitilization) for a commercial case unless the base is autarchic - a word which usually refers to individual liberty and governing oneself - but in this context I think he must mean, producing everything it needs, independent of Earth.\\n\\nSo it is rather similar to Elon Musk\\'s idea except that in Elon Musk’s vision, the settlement is supported by private funding from Earth in the early stages rather than government funding.\\n\\nZubrin then discusses the possibility of ores on Mars, and we\\'ll come back to this later in this section:\\n\\n...\"Mars may have concentrated mineral ores, with much greater concentrations of ores of precious metals readily available than is currently the case on Earth due to the fact that the terrestrial ores have been heavily scavenged by humans for the past 5000 years. It has been shown that if concentrated supplies of metals of equal or greater value than silver (i.e. silver, germanium, hafnium, lanthanum, cerium, rhenium, samarium, gallium, gadolinium, gold, palladium, iridium, rubidium, platinum, rhodium, europium, etc.) were available on Mars, they could potentially be transported back to Earth at high profit by using reusable Mars-surface based single stage to orbit vehicles to deliver the cargoes to Mars orbit, and then transporting them back to Earth using either cheap expendable chemical stages manufactured on Mars or reusable cycling solar sail powered interplanetary spacecraft. The existence of such Martian precious metal ores, however, is still hypothetical.\"\\n\\nIn his section on Interplanetary Commerce in “Case for Mars” page 239 and following he also suggests deuterium as an export. I\\'ll look at that below, between the section on geological products and the section on fuel exports.\\n\\nHe then goes on to suggest that Mars may play a crucial role for supply of ores and other exports to the asteroid belt once we have humans living there. He suggests Phobos and Deimos may also be valuable as a staging post on the way to the asteroid belt. Which may be true, but that\\'s a rather later stage. I\\'m interested here in the earlier stages before we have large numbers of humans in the asteroid belt.\\n\\nDo correct me if anyone knows of any other papers with detailed discussions of possible exports from Mars. That\\'s all I\\'ve been able to find so far.\\n\\nHowever it is discussed a fair bit online in places like Reddit, and the various Mars forums and spaceflight forums, and enthusiasts have suggested many other ways that they think a Mars colony could become profitable. So what I present here is based on that, as well as some thoughts of my own.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at this a bit more closely, is there anything physical that could be worth exporting, (apart from the science value of the search for life and the information returned)? Also is there anything worth exporting at a reasonably early stage such as the first few decades of a human exploration of Mars either on the surface or telerobotically from orbit?\\n\\nSamples of Mars dust and rock. The first samples could be worth billions of dollars per kilogram to start with, at least that\\'s how much they plan to spend for Curiosity\\'s successor\\'s sample return\\n\\nHowever, the price would go down quickly as we get more samples from Mars of the order of tons of material. You\\'d only return as much as was needed for the scientific research you need to do due to the high price of return of material from Mars.\\n\\nAlso, individuals might want to buy Mars rocks at high prices, but only for as long as they are rare. This would be like supporting a lunar mission by returning and selling Moon rocks. The first few rocks could be valuable to collectors, and if they were issued with a certificate of authenticity as the first rocks to be returned from Mars or the Moon maybe the first few rocks would retain their value. But longer term, how many people would want to buy into something of continually reducing value?\\n\\nThere are also the products of past life. On the surface - all of that has been pretty much completely destroyed by cosmic radiation. But - could there be deposits set down by ancient life below the surface, like our oil and gas and oil shale deposits?\\n\\nYou\\'d think they must be rare or we would have spotted them on the surface. There\\'s no sign at all of outcrops of oil shale. On the other hand, cosmic radiation is very damaging. Would there be anything left of a surface oil shale deposit after billions of years?\\n\\nIt\\'s an exponential process so you get very rapid reductions. Every 650 million years you get a 1000 fold reduction in the concentrations of small organic molecules such as amino acids on the surface because of cosmic radiation. So that\\'s a million fold reduction every 1.3 billion years.\\n\\nCosmic radiation has little effect over time periods of years, decades, centuries or millennia. But over time periods of hundreds of millions of years the effects are huge. After 1.3 billion years, a thousand tons of amino acids gets reduced to a kilogram, with the rest converted mainly to gases like carbon dioxide, water vapour, methane and ammonia. After 2.6 billion years it\\'s down to a microgram (millionth of a gram) and after 3.9 billion years you are down to less than a picogram (a millionth of a microgram) of your original thousand tons deposit.\\n\\nSo, I don\\'t think absence of these deposits on the surface, at least ones easy to see from satellites, really shows that they don\\'t exist below the surface. There could be millions of tons of organics from past life ten meters below the surface, and our rovers so far would probably not spot a thing. The organics of course also have to be there in the first place (surely likely to be patchy, in some places more than in others) and buried quickly - if it took several hundred million years to bury them, much of the organics would be gone also.\\n\\nOil itself is surely not worth the trouble of mining to return to Earth. But if there was some unique biological product on Mars that we don\\'t have on Earth - which you could mine to find there, maybe that could be worth returning to Earth.\\n\\nOrdinary Earth life on Mars, e.g. vegetables, fruit, decorative flowers or whatever. Perhaps Mars could be a \"garden planet\" to export food to orbit and space colonies.\\n\\nMars could potentially be competitive with Earth for export of food for use on spacecraft and other space colonies due to the much lower launch cost, provided that the costs of growing the crops on Mars are also comparable to Earth\\'s (quite a big if in the early stages).\\n\\nBut what about greenhouses in space? It would also have to compete with those. This would require it to be much easier to build a greenhouse on the surface than in space. Since it\\'s a near vacuum and also has such huge diurnal swings in temperature, I\\'m not sure that it has much by way of advantages over, say, Phobos or Deimos, or indeed the Moon which has much less delta v than Mars. Even for export to Mars orbit, it could be as economical or more so to export from the Moon for foodstuffs that can keep for months long transport journeys. See section above: Greenhouse construction - comparison of the Moon and Mars\\n\\nIt could be more economical to export from Mars to Mars orbit rather than from the Moon perhaps for food that can spoil quickly. Another thought, if the natural Mars gravity was an advantage, and for some reason, easier to use than artificial gravity, perhaps it could be worthwhile.\\n\\nIt could also be worth doing if conditions on Mars let you produce unusual food or decorative plants more easily. As an example, it could be worth doing, if you can grow rare flowers on Mars that are very expensive to grow elsewhere, or similarly unusual and tasty rare new food stuffs that grow best on Mars for some reason, perhaps genetically designed for Mars conditions. This is related to the next topic:\\n\\nContinuing to:\\n\\nProducts of present day life. If Mars has interestingly different biology , maybe RNA based, maybe XNA, or not a DNA type chemical basis at all - you might find it worthwhile to grow Mars micro-organisms in greenhouses or special habitats on Mars designed to make conditions conducive for them. Then these might make products useful for Earth.\\n\\n, maybe RNA based, maybe XNA, or not a DNA type chemical basis at all - you might find it worthwhile to grow Mars micro-organisms in greenhouses or special habitats on Mars designed to make conditions conducive for them.

(I don\\'t know why life might need solar storms or high levels of UV radiation but just added that for completeness, given that it may be a totally alien exobiology and we don\\'t know what it can do or how it works in detail - those are sources of energy that could potentially be used by exobiology in theory).\\n\\nof near vacuum, huge temperature differences from day to night, high UV levels, or cosmic radiation and solar storms, and it\\'s easier to grow on Mars than simulate Mars conditions on Earth.

Can\\'t be grown on Earth at all for safety reasons - e.g. photosynthetic life that\\'s more efficient than any Earth based photosynthetic life, or perhaps it depends on symbiotic microbes that would be harmful to the environment of Earth if returned here. Perhaps what we return from Mars is the product of such microbes rather than the microbes themselves. For example, if it is based on XNA then it might not be safe to set up an XNA based ecosystem on the Earth to grow these products, because of the risk of escape and competition with DNA based ecosystems, and if they are also very valuable that could be a reason for growing them on Mars.\\n\\n- e.g. photosynthetic life that\\'s more efficient than any Earth based photosynthetic life, or perhaps it depends on symbiotic microbes that would be harmful to the environment of Earth if returned here.

Can grow on Earth but easier to grow on Mars.\\n\\nThis case might also be another reason to be really careful not to contaminate Mars with Earth life, so that you can continue to grow the native Mars life there without interference from Earth life to make unique products that can only be produced easily from the native Mars life.\\n\\nHowever, even if you can\\'t grow the products safely on Earth, at some point you\\'d have the capability to grow them in Stanford Torus type habitats, biologically isolated from Earth and designed to mimic Mars conditions. Still, by the time that\\'s feasible, export costs from Mars could go down at the same time that prices of such habitats go down, so keeping Mars competitive with them.\\n\\nThis does seem a potential early export that may continue to be commercially viable for quite some time, maybe even indefinitely. But it depends entirely on what we find as we search for life on Mars and also on how easy or safe it is to grow them on Earth, the Moon or elsewhere.\\n\\nGeological deposits. With the dry ice, low atmospheric pressure, cosmic radiation, things will be different from Earth in some respects. For one clear example, its salt deposits are made up of sulfates and perchlorates rather than chlorides as on Earth. Not that those are worth returning, but could it have other more valuable deposits that we don\\'t have on Earth, or rarely find here? Which leads to the next idea, could it have unique rare gemstones for instance?\\n\\nWith the dry ice, low atmospheric pressure, cosmic radiation, things will be different from Earth in some respects.

It\\'s the only place we know of with deposits formed in ancient seas billions of years ago and its past and present climate is unique too. It might have unique minerals of decorative value.\\n\\nWhat about:\\n\\nGold from Mars (or substitute platinum, or titanium, or whatever you think is especially valuable that you could find on Mars). For gold, perhaps the geological processes on Mars involving water in its past have concentrated deposits of precious metals just as they do on Earth? It\\'s also surely had many iron / nickel asteroids hit the planet so may have deposits of platinum, gold etc. for similar reasoning to Dennis Wingo\\'s reasoning for the Moon. Indeed more so, because it is closer to the asteroid belt so gets hit by them more often. Robert Zubrin\\'s list here silver, germanium, hafnium, lanthanum, cerium, rhenium, samarium, gallium, gadolinium, gold, palladium, iridium, rubidium, platinum, rhodium, europium, etc\\n\\nRemember, that\\n\\nYou have to do all the work to actually run the gold mine on Mars, and then send it into orbit.\\n\\nto actually run the gold mine on Mars, and then send it into orbit.

There may be much easier of access sources of platinum, gold etc. from the Moon if Dennis Wingo is right. If you can get the transport costs from the Moon down to almost zero by using Hoyt\\'s cislunar transport system or similar (see Exporting materials from the Moon ) , it would be very hard to compete with that from Mars.\\n\\nif Dennis Wingo is right. If you can get the transport costs from the Moon down to almost zero by using Hoyt\\'s cislunar transport system or similar (see , it would be very hard to compete with that from Mars. If the mines are operated by humans on Mars, you have to pay for all the supplies to the miners on Mars which could amount to trillions of dollars a year, before you can turn a profit. For telerobotic or robotic mining you have to pay for the telerobot replacement, maintenance and repair and you also have to pay for all the equipment needed, drilling machinery etc. Will humans be able to compete with telerobots or robots operated from Earth with maybe just a small number of humans in situ?\\n\\nSo, in short, it has to be competitive with platinum, gold etc. mined elsewhere in the solar system, and you have to bear in mind that the prices you can get from Earth will surely go down, or else your exports are limited to keep the prices artificially high. On the other hand if the material you are mining is very valuable, and launch costs are low, perhaps the margin due to cost of export from Mars doesn\\'t make such a big difference. E.g. suppose the launch costs a few hundred million dollars but you are returning tons of material, worth billions of dollars, perhaps it doesn\\'t matter so much that a few percent of your product\\'s price is due to transport. Maybe other elements of the price such as mining are somewhat less expensive than they are for asteroids?\\n\\nHowever for this to work, there has to be a reason why other elements of the cost of mining are low. Asteroids and the Moon have the advantages of:\\n\\nIron rich asteroids consist of pure metal , not oxidized.\\n\\n, not oxidized. There may be easy robotic ways to extract it e.g. using gas carbonyls, no need for drilling as this turns the metal directly into gas\\n\\ne.g. using gas carbonyls, no need for drilling as this turns the metal directly into gas Much lower delta v requirements than Mars for some of the NEOs, and in case of the Moon could even be zero delta v with Hoyt\\'s cislunar tether transport system.\\n\\nIt seems unlikely that the thin Mars atmosphere would help much with mining operations. Would the Mars gravity help, or be a hindrance? And the large temperature swings from day to night, could they help in any way to make it easier to mine materials?\\n\\nGetting colonists to pay using their fee for the passage out to Mars and to subsidize exports by using the nearly empty vessels for the journey back.\\n\\nJust to make this clear, this is not Elon Musk\\'s idea. As we saw, he thinks the colony would pay for itself in the early stages mainly through sale of intellectual property rights to the Earth. And Robert Zubrin, as we saw, thinks it will be paid for in early stages through government funding. But it\\'s a topic that gets discussed in the online forums. So let\\'s have a look at it.\\n\\nIf you get colonists who pay in advance for their flight out to Mars - and they use the Mars Colonial Transporter - a 100 people at a time, if SpaceX succeed in producing that spaceship - then the spacecraft has to come back to Earth after every run to transport colonists to Mars, and would be able to take exports with it, which is essentially free transport. So there would be a multiplier effect there of the original passage fee.\\n\\nHowever unless the products are already worth returning for one of the other reasons, then at most they could get back their original passage fee by selling the material. Otherwise you\\'d have a case for sending empty colonial transporter ships to Mars just to return the products.\\n\\nSo, you\\'d get exports, yes, for as long as the colony continues to expand rapidly. However, that\\'s not a business case in the long term, as it\\'s not going to be sustainable, as a way of supporting a colony there. Even if they can get their money for the flight back from the goods returned from Mars, they then have to support themselves on Mars indefinitely, not just pay for the flight out. And with increasing numbers of colonists on Mars, you\\'d need exponentially increasing numbers of colonists going out there to support them with the passage fees. If you get increasing numbers of spaceships sent there to send them their supplies, again you need to pay for that somehow.\\n\\nSo, I don\\'t think relying on the nearly empty transporter as it returns to Earth as a way to support the colony is likely to work long term. It works only as long as you have exponentially increasing numbers of colonists going to Mars and nobody coming back or few people coming back.\\n\\nPaid for by retirees to Mars. This is another idea sometimes mentioned online - could a small colony be paid for by retirees? Perhaps some people might be willing to pay large amounts to “retire to Mars” and older people nearing the end of their lives are more likely to be able to afford such a trip using their life’s savings.\\n\\nAfter the initial romance of being “the first settlers on Mars” is over, would there be such huge demand to retire to Mars with not so much by way of home comforts as Earth and far away from their friends, relatives and children?\\n\\nIt could work perhaps if many of them are near the end of their life, and don’t live long after they reach Mars (just a few years), but it assumes a large market for this. Also many sixty year olds would survive for a couple of decades or more, and some may survive up to 40 years to become centenarians, probably more so in the future, meaning that their initial investment in the project would have to support them possibly for decades just as for the younger folk.\\n\\nAlso, what about medical care and nursing for the higher prevalence of medical conditions in older people? What about care for the ones who develop Alzheimers on Mars? Also, older people, or retirees (in their eighties and nineties) and the ones with fewer years remaining in their lifespan due to health issues would be the ones on average less able to do the many tasks needed to keep the colony running than younger folk.\\n\\nIf it’s a normal mix of old people with young people migrating to Mars, I can’t see the retirees migrating from Earth paying for the requirements of all the younger people for the rest of their life. In that case it becomes again a case of exponentially increasing immigrants needed to pay for it and exponential growth can’t continue for long.\\n\\nExport of deuterium from Mars. In “Case for Mars” page 239\\n\\nThis is one of the main points in the International Commerce section in Case for Mars, and is also often mentioned in discussions, so I should go into it in some detail.\\n\\nSo first, let\\'s look at the data on deuterium abundances in our solar system. Curiosity measured a deuterium to hydrogen ratio five times greater on Mars than in the Earth oceans, probably due to the loss of hydrogen from the upper atmosphere of Mars over billions of years. See Heavy hydrogen excess hints at Martian vapour loss. This is for near surface ice. The Mars meteorite studies also suggest another reservoir of water below the surface with a lower ratio of two to three times that for Earth’s oceans which probably comes from an earlier phase of Mars history. Meteoritic evidence for a previously unrecognized hydrogen reservoir on Mars.\\n\\nDeuterium occurs naturally on Earth in water as 1 in 6,400 hydrogen atoms or 1 part in 3,200 by weight. On Mars it is one deuterium for every 1,284 hydrogens. Though Mars has a higher deuterium to hydrogen ratio than Earth, it’s not the most abundant source of it in the solar system. Rather, Earth’s abundance is if anything rather low, compared with many sources although high compared to the concentrations in the Sun and Jupiter and hydrogen from the solar wind. The solar wind hydrogen trapped in the lunar regolith also has a very low deuterium concentration.\\n\\nVenus has the highest deuterium / hydrogen ratio recorded in our solar system of 120 times Earth’s and so 24 times that on Mars in its atmosphere. Implications of the high DH ratio for the sources of water in Venus\\' atmosphere.\\n\\nMost meteorites that hit Earth have close to terrestrial abundances of deuterium but some have very high levels. This meteorite has 13 times the abundance of Earth’s oceans, so more than twice the abundance for Mars (many types of rock contain hydrogen and so you can measure their deuterium concentrations, this is a chondrite meteorite).\\n\\nJupiter family comets have higher deuterium abundances than Eart,h perhaps around three times terrestrial abundances as for Comet 67p from the Rosetta mission, though there is some question here about whether comet outgassing may somehow concentrate the deuterium and lead to over estimates of the abundances.\\n\\nSo is Mars the best extraterrestrial source for deuterium? And is it worth importing from space at all?\\n\\nCurrently the main use of deuterium is as a moderator in a nuclear reactor. You have the choice of enriching the uranium, and using ordinary water, which is the method used currently in many reactors, or of using ordinary unenriched uranium and heavy water, as is used in heavy water reactors such as the ones developed by India. That works because heavy water slows down neutrons without capturing them so permitting a chain reaction with a lower concentration of radioactive Uranium than light water which captures many of the neutrons.\\n\\nHowever his quoted price of $10,000 per kilogram for deuterium seems a bit high. You can get 99.96% pure deuterium oxide for $1,000 per kg from Cambridge Isotopes. (Deuterium Oxide 100%) You can get 99% pure deuterium oxide for $721 per kg (Deuterium oxide 99%) Unless he’s referring to the price for pure deuterium separated from the oxygen?\\n\\n99% pure deuterium oxide is sufficiently pure for the production of plutonium from uranium. Because of this application, the technology to produce heavy water is tightly regulated and the deuterium produced in a plant is tracked carefully.. (For an example of how this is done, see \"Selection of a safeguards approach for the Arroyito heavy water production plant\" )\\n\\nHe says that the price of deuterium would go up if we develop deuterium / tritium fusion. I don’t really see that, since the main cost comes from extraction and there is no shortage of water to extract it from. Would a higher demand not just lead to us building more deuterium extraction plants, and a search for methods to reduce the costs using larger scale production facilities, for economies of scale, and other methods of generating it, which would reduce the price rather than increase it?\\n\\nAnd what if some other form of fusion power turns out to be more efficient or have advantages over deuterium / tritium fusion? It’s a bit tricky arguing based on a technology we don’t have yet, and there are many possible ways of generating fusion power being explored at present.\\n\\nHe says deuterium would be a natural byproduct of electrolysis of water sourced on Mars, which would produce around one kilogram of deuterium for every six tonnes of water electrolysed on Mars. However to do this then you have to add a deuterium / hydrogen separation stage to the hydrogen production plant. How easy is that? He doesn’t go into details of how it would work.\\n\\nThat 5 times enhancement over the deuterium in Earth’s oceans is still a long way from 100% concentration. It’s normally extracted by using many stages, and each time the amount of deuterium is increased. With only one atom in 1,284 consisting of deuterium you would still need to concentrate it many times over to reach 99% concentrations. For instance water electrolysis, one of the most effective methods of concentrating it, would increase the deuterium concentration 5 to 10 times each time it is used. The 5 times higher concentration on Mars would just save one stage of water electrolysis of many that would be needed. Though in practice electrolysis has such high energy costs it is best used only once for a final stage, for water that is already 50% D2O. The Argentinian plant uses methane as a feedstock because the hydrogen can be dissociated thermally from methane, much more easily than from water. Similarly for other techniques. There are many methods used to extract deuterium. Each of them requires many stages of concentration and I don’t see how an enhancement of 5 times in the feedstock would make a significant difference here.\\n\\nSo that then leads to the practicality of building and operating an extraction plant on Mars and providing the high power levels needed to extract the deuterium (the main reason for its high cost). If it needs vast amounts of electricity to do the separation, it’s not going to be worth doing I think. Also heavy water plants on Earth are large scale and massive structures. This is the heavy water plant in Argentina:\\n\\nHeavy water plant near Arroyito, photograph by Frandres This plant produces most of the world’s deuterium, at a rate of 200 tons per year, and is powered by a nearby hydroelectric power station at Arroyito dam with a power output of 128 MW. (I\\'m not sure how much of that power output is used for the plant, do say if any of you know). The equipment for extracting deuterium weighs 27,000 tons including the support structures and includes 250 heat exchangers, 240 pressure vessels, 90 gas compressors 13 reactors and 30 distillation columns. (Statistics from Arroyito Heavy Water Production Plant, Argentina)\\n\\nWould the five times higher concentration of deuterium lead to more than a minor saving in the costs of the plant? And how would that offset all the difficulties of setting up and operating the plant with near vacuum conditions outside it, as well as transport costs for equipment that can’t be built on Mars?\\n\\nOf course Mars is different in many ways and though most of them seem to be disadvantages for operating such a planet, could any of them be advantages, such major advantages that it makes it worthwhile to build and operate it on Mars? For instance, could the near vacuum of its atmosphere be made an advantage somehow? (E.g. for distillation).\\n\\nOn the face of it, there doesn’t seem to be a compelling commercial case for this. If there is, it needs to be spelt out in more detail.\\n\\nMost of the details here come from Heavy Water: A Manufacturers’ Guide for the Hydrogen Century. Future Trends in Heavy Water Production (1983) - has details of the Argentina plant, and Heavy Water Production.\\n\\nExport of fuel to Mars orbit and further afield\\n\\nSome of the internet discussions talk about this as a business case. The main issue I see with supplying fuel from the Mars surface is, would it compete with fuel generated on Deimos or indeed on the Moon for astronauts in orbit around Mars. Also, is methane valuable enough as a fuel in space, to make it worthwhile to export hydrogen to the Mars surface to convert into methane and return to orbit, or to split the hydrogen from water on Mars and use it to make methane?\\n\\nThat leads to the next idea:\\n\\nExport of water from Deimos for use as fuel in LEO (if there is water ice on Deimos).\\n\\nThis is the premise of the Deimos Water Company outlined by David Kuck. The delta v back to Earth is much less than from the Mars surface, and you can produce your own fuel for the journey. It would have to compete with volatiles on the Moon if those exist and are easy to mine. I think it\\'s hard to judge this at present as we don\\'t know what the volatiles are like on the Moon. We know they exist but don\\'t know how abundant they are locally, or how easy or hard they are to extract. And so far we don\\'t yet know for sure if there are any volatiles on Deimos, although spectroscopically it resembles a type of asteroid that often has them.\\n\\nSupposing Deimos and the Moon have volatiles equally easy to extract, then the Deimos volatiles would still be favourable for use on Deimos and Phobos and for export to the Mars surface. They would also be favourable for delivery to Mars orbits such as Mars capture orbit at a delta v of 0.57 km / sec from Deimos. So, it would make a lot of sense for a base on Deimos to supply fuel to the Mars system. But that\\'s not a commercial case for colonization. As Zubrin says - you need something over and above ISRU for a commercial case for exports you sell to pay for the things you can\\'t produce there.\\n\\nSo we need to look into whether this can be competitive with the Moon for supply to the Earth Moon system. For the Moon to LEO the delta v is 5.7 km / second, and a bit more if supplied from polar regions - while it\\'s 4.87 km / sec for Deimos to LEO which would seem to favour Deimos. However that does not take account of Hoyt\\'s cislunar tether transport which could make the delta v for supply from the Moon to LEO almost zero.\\n\\nSo, in summary, there do seem to be a number of potential exports from Mars even at quite an early stage, although this is mainly based on internet discussions with not much actually published on the topic in peer reviewed journals. But they all depend on future discoveries so we won\\'t know if this is possible until we know more about Mars. A few of the potential exports, involving exobiology, might require us to keep Earth microbes out of Mars.\\n\\nThere may also be exports from Deimos, but that depends on how easy it is to extract the volatiles, and if the lunar volatiles are as easy to extract as the ones from Deimos, then it might be hard to put a business case for export from Deimos to the Earth / Moon system, though it may be very useful for volatiles for spacecraft in orbit around Mars, on its moons or on its surface. As for exports to the asteroid belt, the chances are that they will find a way to mine their own volatiles out there, so it seems an unlikely case to me for the special case of volatiles.\\n\\nHere I\\'m using the delta v figures from Hop David\\'s cartoon delta v map.\\n\\nHere are some of the online discussions I looked at. Of course they are not always 100% accurate. This is just enthusiasts discussing the topic, some more knowledgeable than others, and it may also contain a fair bit of nonsense in some of the discussions, so you have to filter and look up details to see if what they say is correct. Anyway if you are interested in doing that, see for instance:\\n\\nWikipedia also has a page on Space Trade, though there isn\\'t much in it yet. Then there\\'s Robert Zubrin\\'s paper, already mentioned, and the Interplanetary Commercesection of Case for Mars.\\n\\nThat\\'s about it, do let me know if you have more sources!\\n\\nWOULD A SPACE COLONY SURVIVE WITH ONLY EXPORTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO PAY FOR IMPORTS?\\n\\nAs we saw, Elon Musk and Robert Zubrin both are skeptical about any possibility of material exports from Mars, at least in the early stages (though Zubrin thinks there might be a case for deuterium exports), and both think that a space colony could pay for imports solely through licensing of intellectual property to Earth. Robert Zubrin draws the analogy with the \"Yankee Ingenuity\\'s flood of inventions\" which he says was due to a situation of acute labour shortage in the US in a technological culture, which would be paralleled on Mars. But how would that work in practice?\\n\\nFirst, for US readers, I\\'d like to point out that this whole idea is based on a US perspective on inventions. I\\'m from the UK and we also talk about our country as the source of a flood of inventions, frequently. Here is an example.\\n\\n\"We\\'re a nation of inventors, from the worldwide web to the electric vacuum cleaner - here\\'s a rundown of our most influential innovations\", intro to a list of the 50 greatest British Inventions from the UK in the Radio Times.\\n\\nAnd putting aside national pride, which all countries have, surely for such a small country, we have indeed made many inventions here. We don\\'t have the same narrative that it was due to a labor shortage, nor do we think of the U.S. that way either. I\\'m not talking about historians here, but ordinary folk. Robert Zubrin\\'s quote was the first I heard of this idea, which I assume from the way he put it, must be quite commonly accepted in the U.S. We just think that we are a nation of inventors, and leave it at that. We don\\'t try to explain why.\\n\\nAt any rate if it\\'s true of the U.S., surely it can\\'t explain why we have so many inventions from the U.K. as we\\'ve never had a significant labor shortage. Indeed the opposite, here technology put many skilled people out of work leading to uprisings by working people during the industrial revolution followed by military repression\\n\\nThe leader of the Luddites - self employed weavers who feared getting put out of work by the newly introduced weaving technology of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, and replaced by less skilled workers. They destroyed industrial equipment in protest. Later on agricultural workers joined in, destroying threshing machines. The U.K. government responded by military action against them, executions, deportation, and they made destroying industrial machinery a capital offence. The US narrative that invention was the result of a labour shortage just doesn’t work when applied to UK inventions. It was almost the opposite, inventions caused a labour shortage here, at least of skilled workers\\n\\nAlso we can try to be more objective and look at metrics that measure the talent and creativity of a country. The rankings vary from year to year, but in 2015, for R&D investment, Israel is top, ( 4.4 percent) followed by Finland (3.84 percent), South Korea (3.74 percent), Sweden (3.38 percent), and Japan (3.26 percent). For patents, South Korea is top ( 3,606 patent applications per million people) follwed by Japan (2,691), Singapore (1,878), Hong Kong (1,797) and the United States (1,644). For the percentage in the creative class (workers in science and technology and engineering; arts, culture, entertainment, and the media; business and management; and education, healthcare, and law), Luxembourg takes top spot with more than half (54 percent), and United States is a fair way down the list at (33 percent) rank. For education, South Korea takes the top spot with a 100 percent in universities, colleges etc (tertiary education), and the United States is second (94 percent) with Finland just behind in third (94 percent). When you add in tolerance (which makes your country more open to creative people from other countries and to the ideas of creative minorities in your own country) then Canada is top followed by Iceland, New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The US is eleventh.\\n\\nWhen you combine all these measures, the U.S. comes only second after Australia. So it doesn’t seem that being very inventive is the most important factor when it comes to becoming a leading technological nation and that education, percentage in the creative class and tolerance also has a lot to do with it. And there doesn’t ‘seem to be much evidence of inventiveness being associated with a labor shortage. See list of the most creative countries and then for the detailed stats, Global Creativity Index,\\n\\nAlso, the space colonists would be using many inventions from Earth, so surely they would have to pay many royalties in the other direction back to Earth? How could it be possible to set up a system where the Earth has to pay royalties to Mars and not vice versa?\\n\\nAnd then - how also could it work, even if a space colonists did turn out to be much more inventive than Earth? The only people who would be able to earn foreign currency for imports to Mars would be the ones who make these inventions. But it\\'s not enough to be inventors. They have to make their inventions into paying inventions also. And highly profitable inventions too, to pay for such items as spacesuits.\\n\\nIt’s best to think of spacesuits as more like mini spaceships than the suits of science fiction stories and movies, which are depicted as not much more complicated than wetsuits with aqualungs. They have to be pressurized to hold in atmosphere at a pressure of tons per square meter when surrounded by a vacuum, yet also flexible too with many joints, also able to withstand minute micrometeorites hitting at kilometers per second, and to keep the astronaut cool because the vacuum of space is a good insulator, like a vacuum flask. This makes them far more complex than any diving equipment.\\n\\nA typical NASA spacesuit would probably cost about $2 million dollars to build from scratch - that’s as a recurring item, not including the initial design costs. It requires about 5,000 hours of work and would take someone who had all the necessary skills about two and a half years to build, given supply of all the parts and materials needed. I get those details from Space suit evolution (NASA). It’s possible that this could change with future designs. But that’s the current situation, and for the foreseeable near future.\\n\\nI\\'m an inventor, and I have invented dozens of things (mainly games and software ideas) but I only earn dollars per day from them, and many have never been published in any form (attempted to publish some of them with no success).\\n\\nSimilarly I\\'ve written many original articles, but again, though I earn a bit from the kindle booklets, it\\'s only a dollar or two a day, at present anyway. And that\\'s not at all unusual. For instance I have many composer friends, but it is rare for them to earn a living entirely from composing.\\n\\nAs for composers, artists, writers, or other creative people, earning amounts that would let them buy multi-million dollar spacesuits for all their friends, and ship them to a space colony - well forget about it, unless the next Harry Potter is written on Mars. Even then, J. K. Rowling’s estimated wealth is 1 billion - enough to buy spacesuits for 500 people. She earns 23 million a year, enough to pay for 11.5 spacesuits a year. You’d need a lot of J. K. Rowling’s to support a large Mars colony.\\n\\nAmong all my friends and relatives here in UK, another country with a high proportion of inventors, then yes many of them are indeed innovative and creative and inventors in spirit. But I can\\'t think of many that make a living from their inventions, especially just as intellectual property rights. It\\'s the same also for software programmers - most independent shareware developers that I know, often authors of very inventive software, do it part time, and couldn\\'t earn enough from it to support themselves or their families.\\n\\nOnly a few of all the people who invent things go on to make millions of dollars from their inventions, enough to pay for spacesuits and the like for all their friends and colleagues if they so wished. Even Elon Musk came close to bankruptcy once, in his worst year.\\n\\n\"We were running on fumes at that point,\" Musk says. \"We had virtually no money... a fourth failure would have been absolutely game over. Done.\" Elon Musk in an interview with Scott Pelley, March 30 2014.\\n\\nSo there is a measure of luck there as well. SpaceX would not be here today if his fourth test flight had gone wrong.\\n\\nSo, if you had a million colonists, I don\\'t think we can expect to have a million Elon Musk\\'s. You might be lucky to have one. I think it is fair to say he is at least a one in a million success story. And however brilliant he is, would he earn enough just through intellectual property rights on Earth, managed remotely from, say, Mars, to pay for all the imports needed for a colony of a million people? Even a billion dollars a year of earnings is only $1000 per person which wouldn\\'t get you far importing expensive components from Earth to Mars.\\n\\nThere\\'s also the question of how that would work in practice. Is it going to be a communal system or even communist (in the good sense) where the inventor\\'s earnings are used equally to support everyone? If so, where is the incentive for the inventor to not just invent, but to go to all the work to get their invention into production, or for entrepreneurs to join in with them? Or is it the case that the inventors who are successful are the only ones who earn anything in Earth currencies, and so are the only ones who can afford to import goods, and they then sell them on to the other colonists at any price they care to set in the local Mars currency? And what’s to stop them from emigrating to Earth once they become financially successful, especially since most of their earnings would accrue on Earth and the on the spot business decisions would be made on Earth, and the meetings with investors and manufacturers etc. would also be done there?\\n\\nI\\'m not expert in politics or economics. I may well be missing something here. But it seems on the face of it to be quite a problematical way to support a colony. I\\'m interested in any thoughts on this - do say in comments on the Science20 articles or the kindle booklets pages or here.\\n\\nOn the face of it, at least, this seems a major advantage of the Moon, that you\\'d have many different revenue streams to pay for imports, at least potentially.\\n\\nIntellectual property rights and royalties of course, for any inventions and intellectual creations , the same as for Mars. If Robert Zubrin is right, you have the same labour shortage in a highly technological society, which he thinks should lead to creation of lots of valuable intellectual property in space.\\n\\n, the same as for Mars.

Tourists as well. It\\'s reasonably possible that you\\'ll get wealthy tourists going for holidays on the Moon in the not so distant future. But who would go on a holiday to Mars, whether to the surface or to orbit or its moons, if it means you have to take two years or more out of your life to go there and back? Venus also seems too far away to have much tourist traffic in the near future. The Moon seems likely to get the lion\\'s share of any space tourist industry beyond LEO in the near future, unless transport is speeded up hugely, and especially also given the much higher costs of a long mission to Mars or elsewhere in the solar system.\\n\\nI haven\\'t listed exports of Helium 3 for fusion here. Although it gets a lot of publicity, it\\'s based on technology we don\\'t have, and some experts think we will never have it, and requires mining large areas of the lunar surface. Also, the helium 3 you would get from mining all the regolith to a depth of 3 meters would produce as much power as you\\'d get from solar cells you could make on the surface for much less effort using lunar silicon melted in situ, in seven years. So would it not make more sense just to build solar cell power plants on the Moon and beam the power back to Earth? It may however be a useful byproduct of other mining operations on the Moon. For details, see Case for Moon First - Helium 3.\\n\\nOf those, only the first, intellectual property, applies to Mars, at least in the early stages.\\n\\nThat is of course, apart from the ideas mentioned in the previous section, but they are none of them things we can count on right away, and some may depend on keeping Earth microbes out of Mars.\\n\\nAlso, if Mars geology could lead to unique gems such as the possible Mars opals of the previous section, then what about the Moon? Might it also have unique exports that can only form in the lunar conditions? For instance, could there be lunar gems?\\n\\nSurprising discovery in 2008 - the near side of the Moon has large deposits of relatively pure chromite spinel, which is a gemstone on Earth. This was discovered from orbit. The moon rocks have small amounts of spinel mixed up in them, but this was a much stronger signal. Could the Moon have spinel gemstones? As with the Mars gems, if they exist, they probably wouldn\\'t be worth the cost of returning to Earth unless they have something distinctive about them due to formation in lunar conditions.\\n\\nOr might there be anything else unique to lunar geology that we might prize back on Earth?\\n\\nMAINTENANCE COSTS\\n\\nFor a profitable colony, I think the main thing in the very long term is how easy it is to maintain habitats and equipment in the years and decades into the future. If habitats have to be replaced every few decades (as for the ISS), and spacesuits similarly, the long term costs are going to be very high even if the startup costs are reduced.\\n\\nAs an example, the ISS cost €100 billion so over $110 billion, see How much does it cost?with a design life of about three decades (though it may be extended), and normal maximum number of inhabitants six. That makes the cost about 600 million a year or so per inhabitant with most of that due to the limited design life of the ISS.\\n\\nThe projected cost for the Stanford Torus was over $200 billion in 1975 US dollars for ten thousand inhabitants. That’s around a trillion dollars in 2016 dollars (Inflation Calculator), or a hundred million dollars per inhabitant.\\n\\nIf we can find a way to pay for a habitat as a one off cost, for instance through government funding, private funding, or it pays for itself commercially (the Stanford Torus was going to be paid for by exports of solar power from space to Earth), then the main issue after that is how to maintain it.\\n\\nIf the habitats costs a few hundred thousand dollars a year per inhabitant, then still, only the very rich could live there even after the build costs are paid off, and no matter how much the initial build costs are reduced, unless its exports are very valuable.\\n\\nThen, if you can build the same habitats on Earth, for instance in a desert or floating on the sea, with no cost for its breathable atmosphere or cosmic radiation, solar flare and micrometeorite shielding, the exports from space have to be very valuable to make the space colonies competitive.\\n\\nIf you can reduce the maintenance cost to say hundreds of dollars per year per person then space does have some advantages over Earth, with no storms or earthquakes (depending where you build), no weathering from rain, wind, etc. Then a “home in space” might become a viable long term prospect.\\n\\nOn the downside you have micrometeorites, cosmic radiation, need for spacesuits etc. Can the cost of those really be reduced so much, or the exports from space be so valuable, that they compete with costs of maintenance due to weathering of buildings on Earth?\\n\\nIn this way, an easy to maintain colony will need exports mainly to pay for luxuries, while a hard to maintain colony will need many high value exports just to survive.\\n\\nREDUCING MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR SPACE HABITATS\\n\\nThe three things here of most importance I think are:\\n\\n1. An envelope that is low maintenance to preserve the habitat - to keep in air, and protect against any external hazards such as cosmic radiation, solar flares and micrometeorites.\\n\\n2. A closed system biosphere inside - we need this for any long term space habitat as the logistic requirements and expenses are just too high otherwise. The variation in maintenance costs here would be mainly due to variations in how you supply light and heat to the habitat, and whether you get leaks of gases, water, and other materials that need to be replenished from time to time.\\n\\n3. Maintenance and resupply of equipment for essential needs, for instance space suits, environment control, solar cells\\n\\nFor 2, I know a lot is made of the CO2 atmosphere for Mars but you don’t actually need much by way of in situ resource utilization. For instance if it is a reasonably closed system, you don’t need constant supply of water, CO2, or nitrogen. You just need to be able to top up any losses that there may be in the system. Plants don’t need a constant supply of CO2 to grow, they get the CO2 from the exhaled air of the astronauts. The astronauts in turn get their food and oxygen from the plants. In a biologically closed system those numbers all add up. If you produce enough food from plants, you automatically produce enough oxygen too and the astronauts eating that food produces enough CO2 for the plants to use in their next growth cycle, as the Russians proved in practice with their BIOS-3 experiments.\\n\\nFor 1, the costs can be reduced if you have a single envelope enclosing a large area, for instance a domed city or a cave or a Stanford Torus or O’Neil Colony style spinning space habitat using materials from the asteroid belt. That’s because the area of the envelope goes up as the square of the radius and the volume enclosed as the cube. So the cost per inhabitant of maintenance for the envelope will be much lower for a larger colony.\\n\\nThere the Moon scores over just about anywhere else for the early stages, because of the lunar caves - at least, if they are as large as the Grail data suggests. See Lunar caves. They may be up to kilometers in diameter and over 100 km long. That’s as much internal area as an O’Neil colony, and if it is easy to convert that into a low maintenance envelope for the habitat, turning interior walls to glass perhaps, the maintenance costs might go right down. They would protect from cosmic radiation, solar flares, micrometeorites and hold in the atmosphere against the vacuum of space.\\n\\nYou might wonder about power requirements to produce food on the Moon with the 14 day lunar night. Robert Zubrin uses figures of 4 MW per acre for artificial sunlight in his Case for Mars (page 237) or about a kilowatt per square meter.\\n\\nHowever the power requirements per habitant are far less than you might think as with efficient hydroponics, you only need 13 square meters per person, to provide nearly all their food and all their oxygen, from the BIOS-3 experiments. Also those figures must be for the older halogen lights. Modern LEDs are far more efficient and can be optimized to emit only the frequencies of light that are most useful for plant growth. The result is that you only need 100 watts per square meter or about a tenth of the figures in Case for Mars.\\n\\nWhen you combine those lower power requirements per square meter with the small growing area needed per inhabitant from the BIOS-3 experiments, that makes it only 1.3 kilowatts per inhabitant, which you’d need for 12 hours a day and on the Moon you’d only need it during the lunar night as well. That’s a power level that could be supplied using solar cells and power storage such as fuel cells or batteries for the 14 day lunar night. To find out more about the BIOS-3 experiments etc., see my Could Astronauts Get All Their Oxygen from Algae or Plants? And Their Food Also?\\n\\nI haven’t ‘covered gravity in this section, but go into it in detail in the Case for Moon First\\n\\nVENUS CLOUD COLONIES - A SURPRISING LOW MAINTENANCE SOLUTION\\n\\nHowever if you want to reduce maintenance to an absolute minimum in space habitats, well there is one other place that has far lower maintenance costs even than a lunar cave. It also has greatly reduced initial costs for the habitats as they are very low mass. It’s a surprising one to most of you perhaps. That’s Venus cloud colonies. So I’ll briefly mention those too.\\n\\nVenus, just above the cloud top level, is in some ways the most habitable region in our solar system outside of Earth. The temperature and pressure there is the same as for Earth. There’s abundant sunlight, and clear skies. The atmosphere above you provides the mass equivalent of ten meters of water, shielding you from cosmic radiation and solar flares, also from micrometeorites - they are not an issue at all. Solar flares will cause large scale magnetic effects because Venus has no magnetic field to shield from them - but this is only an issue if you have kilometers long conductive cables - which are not likely to be needed.\\n\\nEarth’s atmosphere is a lifting gas in the dense CO2 of Venus’ atmosphere. And just as with a weather balloon or airship - the pressure is the same inside and outside the envelope. So an airship could be filled with Earth pressure atmosphere with just a thin envelope to hold it in. Even if it is damaged, the air would leak out only slowly and the Venus acid filled atmosphere would also percolate in slowly too. Unlike any other space habitat, it would not be an emergency that you have to respond to in seconds, but something you could repair over a timescale of minutes or hours or even longer.\\n\\nRussian idea for a cloud colony in the upper atmosphere of Venus, proposed in 1970s. This illustration is from Aerostatical Manned Platforms in the Venus atmosphere - Technica Molodezhi TM - 9 1971\\n\\nThis makes the Venus atmosphere the place offworld with the lowest maintenance costs of anywhere, I think. Also its atmosphere has all the main chemicals for life. It has carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur in abundance. The concentrated sulfuric acid is a source of water (it dissociates naturally into water and SO2 in the Venus sulfuric acid cycle). You can make plastics, and you can grow trees and other plants. You could even build new habitats using mainly wood and plastics and some thin layer to protect against sulfuric acid and UV light. Instead of $2 million spacesuits, you have acid resistant suits, which eventually you’d make locally, and aqualung style air breathers. This is a major saving since spacesuits are so complicated, and components for them when they fail would be a large budget item in any space colony I think.\\n\\nVenus also has gravity levels identical to Earth, so if full Earth gravity turns out to be best for human health, this is easily achieved in the Venus cloud colonies.\\n\\nIts long day may seem a disadvantage, as its solar day is a very long 116.75 Earth days. However the upper atmosphere super rotates once every four Earth days in a steady jet-stream like flow which gives the cloud colonies a two Earth day “night” and a two day “day” which is much more acceptable.\\n\\nThe cloud colonies also score at an early stage because you can launch a much larger habitat to the cloud colonies for far less mass per inhabitant. Or much more living space for the same mass sent to Venus. This would be an inflatable habitat like the Bigelow Aerospace idea - but one that is as lightweight as an airship.\\n\\nMuch of this will seem unfamiliar and unlikely to many of my readers. The thing is that ideas for Mars have been worked out in considerable detail, by the Mars colonization enthusiasts and the Mars Society etc. We don’t have any similar advocacy group for Venus or even the Moon. So there’s a tendency to look at everything with “Mars spectacles” and see how the Mars solutions would work on Venus or the Moon. And not surprisingly you find out that the solutions devised for Mars work better on Mars than anywhere else. But once you start looking at these other places in their own right, then a different picture may emerge.\\n\\nIf you are interested in this idea and want to follow it up further, see my Will We Build Colonies That Float Over Venus Like Buckminster Fuller\\'s \"Cloud Nine\"?\\n\\nSo I think at least potentially Venus cloud colonies have the lowest maintenance requirements of all and might well hit that $100s per colonist per year figure at an early stage.\\n\\nStill you need to pay back the initial build costs. The Stanford Torus was projected to take 22 years to build for 10,000 colonists at a cost of around a trillion in 2016 US dollars (seeBuilding the Colony and Making It Prosper). A Venus colony wouldn\\'t need anything like as much mass, for instance no regolith shielding is needed, you only need thin envelopes and there is no need to contain the pressure of an Earth atmosphere against a vacuum. The engineering is simpler as well. You could probably launch it all from Earth for a similar number of colonists over a similar timescale at a much lower cost than the Stanford Torus\\n\\nBut you still need some motivation for doing it. Even if it costs much less, and is easier to maintain once built, how can you do it if there are no profitable exports and they can\\'t pay back the build costs? So let’s just look briefly at its commercial value for exports.\\n\\nORBITAL AIRSHIPS FOR VENUS AND MARS\\n\\nThis depends a lot on how easy it is to export from Venus. That’s why I don’t see this happening in the very near future, for as long as you need massive rockets to launch from the colonies to orbit similarly to the ones needed for Earth. However JP Aerospace are working slowly and steadily on their idea for orbital airships. Even in the near vacuum of the Earth’s upper atmosphere, hydrogen and helium float in the near vacuum of oxygen and nitrogen. And that’s even more so with the denser Venus CO2 atmosphere. They accelerate using ion thrusters, slowly over several days, and meanwhile also rise higher and higher in the atmosphere. Eventually they break the speed of sound barrier - but by then they are so high it is an almost vacuum and it is not a problem.\\n\\nArtist’s impression of orbital airship from JP Aerospace’s Airship to Orbit handout - this would be a very lightweight 6,000 foot airship which slowly accelerates to orbit from the upper atmospheric station using hybrid chemical and electrical propulsion over a period of several days.\\n\\nYou need a staging post at a high level in the atmosphere for Venus or Earth where passengers and goods are transferred to a high altitude orbital airship which is much larger and lighter, designed for upper atmosphere operations. See my Projects To Get To Space As Easily As We Cross Oceans for an overview, also see their book: The Airship to Orbit Program\\n\\nNote that this also applies to Mars too. Their orbital airships would be able to accelerate to orbit from the Mars surface with no need for an upper atmosphere staging post. If this is possible, then you could have both Venus and Mars as “garden planets” and Venus would score over Mars in that respect because the greenhouses would be far less substantial for a larger living area and much lower maintenance.\\n\\nBut the Moon also would have low cost exports because of its low delta v and because of Hoyt’s cislunar transport system which could reduce costs to almost zero (see my Exporting materials from the Moon)\\n\\nApart from this idea of a garden planet, it needs to be some product of the Venus atmosphere. Sulfuric acid is the obvious one, but not especially valuable. Might there be some really high value product? One possibility might be deuterium. As I mentioned in the discussion of Mars exports, Venus has a deuterium / hydrogen ratio 120 times Earth’s (and 24 times that of Mars) Implications of the high DH ratio for the sources of water in Venus\\' atmosphere. Instead of six tons of water electrolysis yielding one kilogram of deuterium, as is the case for Mars water, this would yield 24 kilograms of deuterium, or four kilograms per ton. However as for Mars, can we count on deuterium to be a valuable commodity in the future? And would the higher deuterium levels lead to more than a modest saving in the costs of extracting deuterium? Even with one atom in 54 consisting of deuterium, that’s still far from pure and would require many stages of whatever process is used. On the other hand unlike Mars, Venus does have abundant solar power, even more so than Earth, which may help. Still, as for Mars, this seems a bit of a stretch to me, unless some method is developed for making it much easier to extract deuterium quickly with minimal power requirements - but in that case costs would also be reduced hugely on Earth as well.\\n\\nAs for Mars, another possibility is products of indigenous life, as there is a small chance of life in the Venus clouds. There is indirect evidence in the form of asymmetrical microbe sized particles in the atmosphere and carbonyl sulfide, a clear sign of life here on Earth (though it could be created inorganically on Venus). See my: If there is Life in Venus Cloud Tops - Do we Need to Protect Earth - or Venus.\\n\\nPerhaps it’s possible that we might discover something of high value as we explore and study the Venus clouds. However, we can’t count on it at present.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n\\nSo in short my conclusion is that the Moon is far superior over Mars in this respect and I am skeptical of the idea that a Mars colony could pay for itself via intellectual property. I just don’t see why the flow of intellectual property of commercial value has to be from Mars to Earth rather than vice versa or most likely both ways and I don’t find Robert Zubrin’s labour shortage argument in favour of that at all compelling.\\n\\nAlso it depends on not just inventing things but having the commercial talent to spot how to make the invention financially viable and the persistence and luck to take an invention all the way through to success. Why should Mars colonists be much better at this than anyone else? I don’t get it.\\n\\nBy contrast, I think a Lunar base could potentially be of commercial value, mainly because it has a low escape velocity and is so close to Earth and always at the same distance - especially so if something like Hoyt’s cislunar tether transport system is in place reducing transport costs almost to zero. It is also close enough for tourism to be a major industry eventually.\\n\\nMars I think will be the province of government sponsored or philanthropic explorations for some time - like Antarctica, where the return is not financial but scientific knowledge or just interest / excitement. I think that the initial stages of lunar exploration are also likely to be supported in a similar way - but that there is some possibility there of commercial value entering into the mix as well.\\n\\nAnd I think we should explore Mars from orbit until we have a good understanding of surface conditions and especially not introduce Earth life to the planet. We could exploit it commercially from orbit through telerobotics, but that would depend on finding something there of commercial value to export. And I think conceivably there might be commercial exports from Mars in the future. Especially if the Mars biology produces some unique valuable biological product that can’t be made anywhere else - that might be worth exporting. But there’s currently nothing we know of that could be worth the cost of export from Mars, and whether there will be in the future, only the future can tell.\\n\\nLonger term, Venus cloud colonies also seem of special interest. I suggest they are the least maintenance of all offworld habitats outside of Earth but it isn’t so easy to find a commercial case for more than an Antarctic style habitat maintained because of its science value and perhaps some tourism, because of the high costs of exports to orbit. Long term, if the orbital airships work out and reduce export costs to orbit almost to zero, perhaps Venus could be the best place to grow food for export outside of Earth. Orbital airships would also make Mars more commercially viable too.\\n\\nThis answer is an edited copy of the following sections of my Case For Moon First with some additional material:\\n\\nThis question originally appeared on Quora.

              " 'Next Celebrity wives have a much more notable role than just looking gorgeous on the red carpet; in fact, they have an inseparable part of their famous husbands’ success. In an era where people have become more and more cynical about love and the concept of ‘forever after’, which seems to fade away by the day, it’s nice to see some of our all time favorite celebrity couples still going strong and looking happier than ever. On the other hand, some of these couples gave us some great times to look back on and then broke our hearts by separating for good. ADVERTISEMENT If you think you can go through a mental checklist in your head and name some of the most iconic couples in the entertainment industry, then we’re here to help you out and lengthen that list. As we stroll down memory lane, some of the best romantic scenes will pop up in your head. You’ll think about those on-screen couples that took their chemistry off-screen. You’ll also reminisce about the musicians that played a loving duet together and had a turbulent relationship off stage. Our favorite celebrity couples were the crossbreeds; the athletes, the models, the actresses, and singers! You’ll be amazed by how long some of these couples have been together for and how many children they’ve had. You’ll also be amazed by some of the circumstances surrounding their divorces! These infamous celebrity wives have also managed to keep up appearances, as well their beauty. The aging process doesn’t necessarily apply to these women, whether they’ve had children or decided to fly solo. Thankfully we have pictures of these absolutely attractive couples from when they were young and restless. These then and now pictures of celebrity wives will blow your mind. Start Slideshow\\n\\nJohn Travolta – Kelly Preston | Then In Hollywood there is no better way to meet than on the set of a movie. That was the case for the Grease actor and Kelly Preston who met when they starred on The Experts in 1987. The two married four years later in two different ceremonies – a legal one and a Scientology one as the two are very much into that. John Travolta – Kelly Preston | Now The actor couple is still married, and John and Kelly have three children. Their son, Jett, sadly died in 2009 when he was only 16. The two are still happily married and their red carpet moments are priceless.\\n\\nDustin Hoffman – Lisa Hoffman | Then Dustin rose to fame when he starred on The Graduate, and he hasn’t stopped landing groundbreaking roles since then. Hoffman was first married to Anne Byrne until the two divorced in 1980, and that same year he married his second wife, Lisa whom he settled in Manhattan with and enjoyed the city life. Dustin Hoffman – Lisa Hoffman | Now Dustin and Lisa are still together after more than 35 years, and seem to be more in love than ever. They couple has four children, two boys and two girls and Lisa is the stepmom for Dustin’s two other daughters from his first marriage. Their happy marriage proves that that every ending has a new and sometimes an even more lovely beginning.\\n\\nJack Nicholson – Sandra Knight | Then As surprising as it may sound, Sandra was Jack’s first and only wife. The two tied the knot in 1962 and had one child together, Lisa who is 52 today. Jack always considered children to be the most important thing in his life as he was quoted saying “As a father I’m there all the time. I give unconditional love. And I have a lot of skills in terms of getting them to express themselves.” Jack Nicholson – Sandra Knight | Now Jack and Sandra separated after four years of marriage. Jack who has always known to have his way with the ladies and draw them to him, has never remarried. He has been, however, linked to fellow actresses such as Anjelica Huston and Rebecca Broussard, whom he also shares children with. These days, Sandra is focusing her career on writing rather than on acting.\\n\\nWarren Beatty – Annette Bening | Then The actor, who was once known to be the ladies man and with the reputation of being the ultimate Hollywood bachelor, decided to settle down in his 50’s when he met Annette Bening who seemed to have stolen his heart and pretty much dismissed all those rumors that were running around. One of those rumors has it that the Carly Simon song, You’re So Vain was actually referring to the actor himself. The couple who met on the set of Bugsy in the beginning of the 90’s, tied the knot in 1992. Warren Beatty – Annette Bening | Now After 25 years of marriage and against all Hollywood odds, Warren Beatty and Annette Bening are still going strong. The couple share four children and are still hitting the red carpets looking more beautiful and happier than ever. One of their children, Stephen, is a transgender and a very honest activist for the community. Stephen, who was once Kathlyn before the sex change, is a Sarah Lawrence College student in New York. The actor was quoted earlier this year saying “The most important thing that’s ever happened — the best thing that’s ever happened to me — was Annette and having four kids.”\\n\\nPaul Newman – Joanne Woodward | Then The Oscar winner met his second wife, Joanne, after he ended his marriage to Jackie Witte that lasted 11 years. The two met in 1953 and later shared their talents on the set of The Long Hot Summer, and indeed it was a very long and hot summer as the two married a year later. Paul was one of the hottest actors in his time, so we can only imagine the pressure on Joanne’s part of holding on to that one. Paul Newman – Joanne Woodward | Now The couple was considered one of the strongest power couples after their marriage lasted for 50 years until Paul sadly passed away in 2008. Paul and Joanne share three children apart from the three kids that Paul has from his previous marriage. The couple is probably one of the favorite Hollywood couples in history as they really have been inseparable since the co starred in 1958. Their 50 year bond is a true romantic one and now that Joanne is sadly dealing with the Alzheimer’s disease, she slowly starts to forget all those beautiful memories.\\n\\nClint Eastwood – Maggie Johnson | Then What started as a blind date soon turned into marriage, when the actor and director, Eastwood married model Margaret Maggie Johnson in 1953 when he was only 23 years old. The marriage between one of the more gorgeous men in Hollywood’s history, and his new wife, did not go all smooth and apparently looking good together was not enough for the two to stay together. Clint Eastwood – Maggie Johnson | Now Clint and Maggie’s marriage lasted 31 years until they separated in 1984 after two children together. It didn’t come as a huge surprise as Clint was always considered to have a bit of a drifting look when it came to other women always and he even got another woman pregnant while being married to Maggie. The 84 year old director and actor married his second wife Dina, but the two split and divorced after 17 years. The two have a daughter together, Morgan. Eastwood has two children with his first wife, Maggie Johnson, Kyle Eastwood and Alison Eastwood.\\n\\nSean Connery – Micheline Roquebrune | Then The legendary Bond actor met his future (second) wife, Micheline at a golf tournament in Morocco. Micheline, a Moroccan-French painter and the actor married in a secret ceremony in Casablanca in 1975 and they seemed like a very chic couple who just fit each other perfectly when they shared some similar interests and passions. Connery was actually the first actor to ever play the famous secret agent and has starred in seven of the film series, which made him even more attractive to his wife at the time. Sean Connery – Micheline Roquebrune | Now Connery was once quoted saying about his wife, “What more could a man want than a beautiful wife who not only understands golf but encourages you to play?” The two are still married and are still looking great. Sean, who has already retired from acting after a long and prosperous career is now a devoted grandfather to his cute grandchildren. The legendary actor was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000, a very honorable title which makes us love him even more.\\n\\nRobert Redford – Lola Van Wagenen | Then The good looking actor met his wife of 30 years, Lola, when they lived in the same building in LA. The couple married in 1958 and spent their years looking amazing together and making red carpet appearances together. Robert Redford – Lola Van Wagenen | Now Robert and Lola, who have finalized their divorce in 1985 after 30 years, have four children together. They were always very respectful of one another when they were interviewed. They did manage to find new love and they both remarried since their divorce.\\n\\nElvis Presley – Priscilla Presley | Then You wouldn’t expect anything but an amazing love story from The King himself. When Elvis met Priscilla in 1959 she was only 14 years old. Elvis always had an eye for young women. The lovebirds dated for seven years before they decided to marry in 1967 and had their daughter, Lisa Marie Presley a few months later. Elvis Presley – Priscilla Presley | Now These two’s love story and how it unfolded is probably one of the more publicized ones and we all know the rest. In 1977, Elvis passed away, years after the two had already divorced. Their daughter, Lisa, also pursued a career in music and was famously married to Michael Jackson.\\n\\nWilliam Shatner – Elizabeth Shatner | Then The famous Star Trek star is probably mostly remembered by his role as Captain James T. Kirk. While he did stay committed to the successful franchise, his married life was somewhat more dynamic with four marriages. Elizabeth was Shatner’s fourth wife and the two tied the knot in 2001. William Shatner -Elizabeth Shatner | Now We guess four’s a charm as William and Elizabeth are still going strong and are making public appearances on the red carpet looking very happy. Shatner has been quoted in the press saying that the fourth and last time, he made sure to pick right. He sure did.\\n\\nMichael Douglas – Diandra Luker | Then Before Douglas married the gorgeous Welsh actress, Catherine Zeta-Jones he was married to Diandra Luker for 23 years until they divorced in 1995. It seems that Michael is not afraid of a good age gap as he married Diandra when she was just 19 and he was 32. The two share a son together named Cameron. Michael Douglas – Diandra Luker | Now The couple’s divorce may have left a few broken hearts, but one happy bank account when Diandra walked out with $45 million. She has been out of the spotlight since then , while Douglas has remarried. Douglas is still married to Catherine Zeta-Jones and the couple have two children.\\n\\nMichael Caine – Shakira Caine | Then Although the Batman actor is now quite recognized for his romantic roles, he sure did manage to be romantic when he married his wife, Shakira, a Guyanese actress in 1973. The two come from different backgrounds and religions, but that has never been an issue for the couple. Michael Caine – Shakira Caine | Now After 43 years of marriage, the two are still happily married and the two time Oscar winner, who is 82 today, tells that the secret to their long and happy marriage is having their own space. The actor and his wife who is a fashion designer have figured out the code to a happy life together: “The secret of a good marriage is two bathrooms. You never want to share a bathroom with a woman or you end up with a little corner for your shaving things and stuff. I am older than she is and I need more space.”\\n\\nRobert De Niro – Diahnne Abbott | Then The Taxi Driver actor married the actress and singer, Diahnne Abbott in 1976 and just by the look on his face you can tell he did not have a care in the world. The young couple was a couple who sure did know how to party right. Robert De Niro – Diahnne Abbott | Now After 12 years of marriage, the two divorced in 1988. De Niro has had quite a few relationships since then, one of them was with model, Toukie Smith. These days Robert is married to Grace Hightower while Diahnne has led a low key life away from the spotlight.\\n\\nSean Penn – Madonna | Then It was a definite big surprise when these two got hitched in 1985. The stars, each in their own career, were married for four years and pretty much left many heads turning everywhere they went and every red carpet they hit. Penn and Madonna’s union in marriage is one for the books. Sean Penn – Madonna | Now Needless to mention that the two megastars are still very successful in their careers. Penn is acting and directing and had remarried Robin Wright. The two have two children. Madonna is probably the most successful female artist of all time. She has been married to British director, Guy Ritchie but the two divorced in 2008 after eight years of marriage.\\n\\nHarrison Ford – Calista Flockhart | Then Apart from their 22 year gap, the celebrity couple has enjoyed, or not quite, many separation rumors and voices that claimed that their marriage would never last. The two met in 2002 at the Golden Globe Awards ceremony, and after a long seven year relationship the couple got engaged in 2009 until they finally tied the knot in 2010. Ever since their union there was nothing but PDA for these two lovebirds. Calista is Ford’s third wife. The two adopted their son, Liam in 2011. Harrison Ford – Calista Flockhart | Now Calista and Ford are still married and are still attending the red carpet events together looking very much in love. The 74 actor has had a very busy year with the Star Wars film: The Force Awakens film and he was cast to play in the upcoming film Blade Runner 2049 that is set to be released in 2017. Calsita, who is mostly famous for her Ally McBeal role is still starring on the small screen on the series, Supergirl as Cat Grant.\\n\\nJohnny Depp – Lori Anne Allison | Then Having the reputation of a bad boy in Hollywood, it’s hard to imagine Johnny Depp has already settled down for the first time when he was 20 years old. His first marriage was to Lori Ann Allison in 1983 from whom he divorced from two years later. Lori was a make up artist and we guess they met on a movie set. Johnny Depp – Lori Anne Allison | Now As we all know, Depp has been in two very high profile relationship since his divorce from Lori Anne. His first relationship to Vanessa Paradi ended after fourteen years, after the two had two children together. His second infamous marriage was to Amber Heard whom he is now in the process of a very ugly divorce. Lori has been under the radar since she divorced Depp, but she did show her support for her ex husband during his publicized divorce from Amber Heard, saying he would never lay a hand on a woman after the actor has been accused with domestic violence.\\n\\nJeremy Irons – Sinéad Cusck | Then The British actor who had his big film debut when he starred in the 1981 romantic drama, The French Lieutenant’s Woman married the Irish actress, Sinéad Cusak in 1978. The couple has had a very successful career since they met. The two have two sons named Sam and Max. Irons’ first marriage was to Julie Hallam, and so Cusak was actually his second wife. Jeremy Irons – Sinéad Cusck | Now I’ts been 38 years and the long time lovebirds are still happily married. This forever after case cannot be taked for granted in Hollywood so it’s heartwarming to know that teher are some still power couples left in Tinsel Town.\\n\\nAnthony Hopkins – Jennifer Leyton | Then Sir Anthony, the Hannibal star married Jennifer Leyton in 1972 after he split from his first wife, Petronella. The couple used to appear on the red carpet a lot and were a very stable couple thorugout the years, and in fact they never had any children together. Abigail Hopkins is Anthony’s daughter from his first wife. Anthony Hopkins – Jennifer Leyton | Now The couple who was once going strong split in 2002 after almost 30 years of marriage after they had been living separately for the last two years of their marriage. The Welsh actor has been romantically linked to many women including Joyce Ingalls and Francine Kay. Jenni admitted that separating from Hopkins was a very difficult thing to do and she was quoted: “I don’t find it an easy state….If I’ve got any choice, I don’t want a divorce.” After their divorce they went their separate ways, Anthony remarried and moved to LA and Jennifer remained home in the UK.\\n\\nBruce Springsteen – Juliana Phillips | Then Th Born In The USA singer, also nicknamed the Boss, married Juliana in 1985. Phillips was a model and a successful actress back in the day and was famous for her role as Frankie Reed on the television series, Sisters. The singer and the model were one of the most attractive couples Hollywood has ever known. Bruce Springsteen – Juliana Phillips | Now Their romance ended after four years, but the couple did enjoy their celebrity life and had no children together. Phillips was always known for being the “girlfriend of” of the good looking musician. Their dirty laundry was even mentioned in Bruce’s 1987 Tunnel of Love album where he mentioned a lot of the unhappiness they were experincing. Phillips sure does look amazing today.\\n\\nMichael J. Fox – Tracy Pollan | Then Who knew that co starring on a show named Family Ties would set the stage for forming a real family. Michael and Tracy, who met on the set of the American sitcom back in the 80’s married a few years later. Tracy actually played Fox’s on screen girlfriend but the two only began dating when they costarred once again on Bright Lights. Michael J. Fox – Tracy Pollan | Now Back to the future, the year is 2016 and the good looking couple is still happily married! it seems like there is nothing these two can’t overcome after Tracy has been and still is by her husband’s side through his struggle with Parkinson’s Disease. The couple has four children and Michael, despite his harsh symptoms, is starring on his show, The Michael J Fox Show.\\n\\nJeff Bridges – Susan Geston | Then The Big Lebowski star and one of Hollywood’s leading men, met Susan Geston in 1974 when he was filming a movie called Rancho Delux. Susan was a waitress where the film was shooting. It was almost like love at first sight for the two and just five days after Bridges proposed, the two tied the knot in 1977. Jeff Bridges – Susan Geston | Now We can’t say we’re surprised to find out that the lovely couple is still together and going strong. They have three daughters and are still looking very much in love. Needless to say that they are both still easy on the eyes. The Oscar winner even mentioned his lovely wife in his winning speech saying ”I especially want to thank my gorgeous wife, Sue. We’ve been married 33 years. We have a beautiful family, three girls, Isabelle, Jessie and Haley. Thank you guys, I wouldn’t be up here without you.”\\n\\nBruce Willis – Demi Moore | Then Considered one of Hollywood’s most famous couples, Bruce and Demi met when they attended the premiere of Stakeout. The actor couple tied the knot in 1987 and had three daughters together. The three girls, Rumer, Scout and Tallulah are famous today not just for being the famous couple’s girls. Although the celebrity couple decided to go their separate ways in 2000, they are still very close friends, so close that they were invited to each other’s second weddings. Bruce Willis – Demi Moore | Now Demi was actually married once to Freddy Moore in 1980 and so Bruce was her second husband, while Demi was the actor’s first wife. There’s no doubt that these two set a very good example for other celebrity couples who sadly decided to divorce, with the kind and respectful way they treat each other. Bruce is married these days to model, Emma Hemming. Demi married actor Ashton Kutcher in 2005, and although the pair seemed strong and like another power couple, the two divorced in 2013.\\n\\nMel Gibson – Robyn Moore | Then The Braveheart star did not always have the bad reputation that he is known for today and in fact led a pretty normal family life when he married his actress wife, Robyn Moore in 1980 after the two met after the release of the first Mad Max film in 1977. When Gibson met Robyn she was a dental nurse an the two have seven kids together. Yes, seven children and that doesn’t include Gibson’s other two kids. Mel Gibson – Robyn Moore | Now The Aussie couple has unfortunately gone their separate ways after 31 years and it seems like their long and strong relationship went downhill after Gibson was arrested for drunk driving in 2006. Although there were hopes for the future for the Hollywood couple, their relationship ended but remained considerably friendly due to the seven kids they share. Robyn reportedly walked out of the long marriage with a whooping fortune of £250 million, just enough to get a fresh start.\\n\\nMark Hamill – Marilou York | Then Mostly recognized for his role as Luke Skywalker, the Star Wars star married dental hygienist, Marilou York in 1978, but the road to saying their I Do’s had known some ups and downs. The couple has three children. One of their children, Nathan, who was born while the production of The Empire Strikes Back, made an appearance in the Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace when he played the role of the Royal Guards of Naboo. Mark Hamill – Marilou York | Now The couple who got married in 1978 in a private ceremony is still together and is still looking fabulous on the red carpet with their family. The actor who has had a few personal bumps in his life including the time he was seriously injured in a car crash, has grown stronger and is now a happy man with a very hyped up social media account.\\n\\nChuck Norris – Gena O’Kelley | Then Learning from past mistakes, the martial art professional and the Walker, Texas Ranger actor decided that next time around will be a better one. Norris met his second wife, former model and deputy sheriff in California, Gena O’Kelley, in Dallas in 1997. Their friendship grew into a loving relationship. When he met Gena, the actor was 58 while she was only 30 years old. The couple has twins, a boy and a girl. Chuck Norris – Gena O’Kelley | Now The couple is still married and they live happily with their blended families. Gena has two kids from her previous marriage and Chuck has three other children apart from their twins; one child of which was born out of an extramarital affair. The happy couple have a couple of homes in the South, including a ranch close to Houston.\\n\\nRichard Dreyfuss – Jeramie Rain | Then The Oscar winner who won an Academy Award for his role in the 1977 The Goodbye Girl met actress and producer, Jeramie Rain when she was 34 in the beginning of the 80’s and had three children together. Sadly, their oldest son was born with an unusual genetic eye disorder which left him blind. Richard Dreyfuss – Jeramie Rain | Now Although the couple has had to face some tough situations while being married and you would think they would get them closer together, the couple ended up getting divorced in 1995. Since then Dreyfuss remarried but got divorced again. Rain was diagnosed with systemic lupus when she was 28 and today she is the founder of a charity for children who are diagnosed with the same disease.\\n\\nSylvester Stallone – Brigitte Nielsen | Then The action movie star who is famous for his roles as Rocky Balboa and Rambo married the Danish model and actress on December 15, 1985. The two actors met when Stallone was at the peak of his career. Nielsen also appeared in the Rocky IV movie as well as Beverly Hills Cop. Sylvester Stallone – Brigitte Nielsen | Now The marriage between the good looking actor couple ended after only two years and their breakup was highly covered by the press. Nielsen was Stallone’s second wife and the actor married for the third time in 1997 and now has three daughters. Brigitte, who was also infamously known for her affair with fellow actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was still married, has had some television appearances on the Italian and Swedish television. She has been married five times in total and is married to day to Mattia Dessi and the two live in Palm Springs.\\n\\nBill Clinton – Hillary Clinton | Then It wasn’t always so serious and about the politics for the Clinton couple, as seen in the picture, the loving couple was a hippie one back in the seventies. Bill met Hillary at Yale when they were both studying law. The two met in 1971 and married in 1975. Their daughter, Chelsea, was born in 1980. Bill Clinton – Hillary Clinton | Now The couple is probably doing the best they’ve ever been. Clinton who took office and became the 42nd president of the United States in 1993, supported his democratic wife in her running for presidency just a couple of months ago. There’s no doubt that if Hillary would have won the election the two would have broken a record for being the most political couple in the world. We just can’t get enough of the Clintons.\\n\\nRichard Gere – Cindy Crawford | Then The good looking actor sure did date some pretty women before he starred in the 1990 hit movie. Gere started dating supermodel Cindy Crawford when she was only 21 and when the two had a big age difference. They were probably one of Hollywood’s most attractive couples of all time. The couple got married in 1991 and when they attended the red carpet they looked like they were taken out of a magazine. Richard Gere – Cindy Crawford | Now After four years of marriage, the couple divorced in 1995. Gere remarried model Carey Lowell and they have a son. They separated after 11 years. The former supermodel is looking as beautiful as always. She married a fellow model named Rande Gerber in 1998 and the two have two very attractive children. Their daughter Kaia is pursuing her modeling career these days.\\n\\nMichael York – Patricia McCallum | Then The 74 year old actor who has had an impressive career in film and in television, met photographer, Patricia McCallum when she was hired to take his pictures in 1967. The two got married a year later on York’s 26th birthday. Michael York – Patricia McCallum | Now The couple who got married in 1967 is still together and are looking very happy. They still arrive on the red carpets looking sharp and gorgeous. They have one son, Rick McCallum, the Star Wars producer, who is actually York’s step son. The actor announced in 2013 that he was diagnosed with amyloidosis, but having his wife to support him makes him stronger as each day goes by.\\n\\nTim Allen – Laura Diebel | Then The comedy actor met Laura Diebel when he was doing his Bachelor’s degree in television and radio production at Western Michigan University.

In 1997 he had another bump when he was charged with drunk driving but was doing great on his series, Home Improvement and on the Toy Story movie.\\n\\nJeff Goldblum – Geena Davis | Then It is known that when working together for many hours on set and spending so much in each other’s company, fly sparks and romances may hit. We guess that was the case for Jeff and Geena who got married in 1987 after they worked on three different films together. Jeff Goldblum – Geena Davisl | Now These two cannot be more apart from each other these days. Geena, who was the actor’s second wife turned to the small screen and you could see her extraordinary performance on season 11 of Grey’s Anatomy, while Jeff continued with this successful career and was in charge of the comic spin off of the Jurassic Park series.\\n\\nKelsey Grammer – Camille Grammer | Then The Frasier star himself married the Playboy model in 1997 and it seems like their marriage was doomed from the get go since the two had a very nasty divorce that was finalized in 2011. We hope this didn’t effect their two children too badly. Kelsey Grammer – Camille Grammer | Now Just like many stars do these days, Camille turned to reality television when she was part of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills on the franchise’s eleventh season. Kelsey went on to appear on television as well as in film, and some of his film work includes X-Men: The Last Stand and The Expendables 3.\\n\\nColin Firth – Livia Giuggioli | Then The British actor married Livia in 1997, soon after he split from his long time partner of five years, Meg Tilly. Colin and Livia have two sons named Luca and Matteo. Colin Firth – Livia Giuggioli | Now It’s lovely to see that Firth and his wife are still going string and they are happily married. It’s hard to miss Colin as he is one of the busiest actors in Hollywood. His outstanding performance on the 2010 biographical movie, The King’s Speech even won the British actor an Oscar as well as other important words.\\n\\nAntonio Banderas – Melanie Griffith | Then We guess the sparks that flew on the film that they co starred together were just Too Much for the these two to handle that they had to act on their love. Antonio and Melanie, who met in 1995 married the following year and that was actually the second time around for Banderas. Their love was so passionate that Griffith even tattooed her husband’s name on her body.

Kim will have a very sassy role in the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey film.\\n\\nRobert Downey Jr. – Deborah Falconer | Then He was always considered as a Hollywood bad boy, and that could explain his rash decision to marry Falconer after only 42 days. They must have done something right as the two were married for 12 years until they divorced in 2004. Their divorce was blamed a lot on the actor’s drinking problems. Robert Downey Jr. – Deborah Falconer | Now After the two got divorced, Robert quickly found himself in a new relationship and he married Susan Downey in 2005. Robert is doing very well in his personal life as he’s been sober for quite some time now, as well as with his career. His latest performance was on the hit film, Iron Man.\\n\\nAndre Agassi – Brook Shields | Then Brooke Shields and Andra Agassi were married from 1997 until 1999. The professional tennis player and the actress had a turbulent marriage – Agassi was addicted to crystal meth for the majority of their relationship and it eventually took a toll on their union. When Booke suggested that they go to couples counseling, to develop their communication skills and help Andre into recovery, he refused. Brooke filed for divorce soon after, but still considers Andre to be a good human deep down. At the time he would have done anything for his wife and her, in return. Andre Agassi – Brook Shields | Now Today, Brooke became the successful actress we all know and love, and Andre has since retired, although, he released a tell-all memoir in 2009. Brooke wasn’t a fan of the autobiography, but she did sit with her ex-husband’s ghost-writer to get the most pivotal points of their marriage depicted correctly. Brooke doesn’t feel that she was as poorly portrayed as she had initially expected, but the past partners aren’t necessarily close friends now, either.\\n\\nGary Oldman – Uma Thurman | Then Oldman and Thurman met when they were both playing in the 1990’s action movie, State of Grace. What started as love at first sight soon ended after only two years. That was actually Gary’s second time around while it was Uma’s first. Since they broke their marriage, Gary had remarried three times and Uma married co star, Ethan Hawke. Gary Oldman – Uma Thurman | Now Since their split in 1992, the two actors had basically zero contact. While Gary is in the process of another divorce, Thurman’s acting career was on the rise, where she acted in box office hits like the Kill Bill series. What went on between the two when they were married was never publicized, and the Oldman’s domestic violence charges did not help his image over the years. When Thurman was asked about their marriage, she quite openly said that “…it ended. As it needed to.”\\n\\nTommy Lee – Heather Locklear | Then Nothing says a match made in rock heaven like a matching hairdo! Before her Richie Sambora days, The Melrose Place star was married to another rockstar, Tommy Lee. The two were married from 1986 till 1993. When asked about Lee, the actress simply said that he was very “tiring”. The hot couple broke off their marriage after Lee reportedly didn’t want to start a family. Tommy Lee – Heather Locklear | Now Heather Locklear looks like she didn’t age one bit. While she’s not so much in acting anymore, she did have her fair share of relationships. Locklear’s recent relationship was when she was engaged to her former co star, Jack Wagner. Tommy Lee’s famous band, Motley Crue basically split up and he recently published his autobiography named Tommyland. The two seem to have stayed quite close according to a photo Locklear posted on her Instagram account: A nostalgic photo of the two kissing captioned ” Happy 30 years anniversary, baby!”\\n\\nHank Azaria – Helen Hunt | Then While many of Hollywood’s couples tend to rush things out, Azaria and Hunt took their time and only got married after they were dating for five years. However, their long term relationship wasn’t so helpful after all, as the couple split one year after they tied the knot. Hank was very open and candid about how painful the breakup was to him, especially due to Hunt’s rise to fame and the fact that he had to see her everywhere after they were no longer together. Hank Azaria – Helen Hunt | Now The two have moved on since they split, and it seems like Azaria got over his broken heart when he married Katie Wright, his second wife, whom he has a child with.

They have finally decided to get married in the early 00s’ and actually did it in 2006. Beth was “Dog’s” fifth wife. Duane Chapman (Dog the Bounty Hunter) – Beth Smith | Now Today, the controversial couple continues making headlines with their scandalous behavior. Beth works in a bail bonds office and goes bounty hunting with her “Dog”.\\n\\nPeyton Manning – Ashley Thompson | Then The famous former NFL quarterback who is mostly famous for playing for the Indianapolis Colts, married Ashley Thompson in 2001 on St. Patrick’s Day. They started dating before her famous beau even started college. The businesswoman has mostly stayed away from the spotlight since she met Peyton. Peyton Manning – Ashley Thompson | Now The couple is still going strong and are happily married. In 2001 they welcomed twins, a girl and a boy. Ashley is juggling between supporting her husband’s career, running her business and raising their four-year-old twins.',\n",
              " '\\n\\nCelebrity wives have a much bigger role than just looking gorgeous on the red carpet – they play an inseparable part of their famous husbands’ success. In an era where people have become more and more cynical about love and the concept of “forever after,” it’s nice to see some of our favorite celebrity couples still going strong. On the other hand, some of these couples gave us some great times and then broke our hearts by separating. Dustin Hoffman – Lisa Hoffman | Then Dustin Hoffman rose to fame when he starred on The Graduate, and he hasn’t stopped landing groundbreaking roles since then. Hoffman was first married to Anne Byrne. But the two divorced in 1980, and that same year he married his second wife, Lisa whom he settled in Manhattan with and enjoyed the city life. Dustin Hoffman – Lisa Hoffman | Now Dustin and Lisa are still together after more than 35 years, and seem to be more in love than ever. The couple has four children, two boys and two girls and Lisa is the stepmom to Dustin’s two other daughters from his first marriage. Their happy marriage proves that that every ending has a new and sometimes an even more lovely beginning.\\n\\nJack Nicholson – Sandra Knight | Then As surprising as it may sound, Sandra was Jack’s first and only wife. The two tied the knot in 1962 and had one child together, Lisa who is 52 today. Jack always considered children to be the most important thing in his life as he was quoted saying, “as a father I’m there all the time. I give unconditional love. And I have a lot of skills in terms of getting them to express themselves.” Jack Nicholson – Sandra Knight | Now Jack and Sandra separated after four years of marriage. Jack who has always known to have his way with the ladies and draw them to him, has never remarried. He has been, however, linked to fellow actresses such as Anjelica Huston and Rebecca Broussard, whom he also shares children with. These days, Sandra is focusing her career on writing rather than on acting.\\n\\nWarren Beatty – Annette Bening | Then The actor, who was once known to be the ladies man and with the reputation of being the ultimate Hollywood bachelor, decided to settle down in his 50’s when he met Annette Bening who seemed to have stolen his heart and pretty much dismissed all those rumors that were running around. One of those rumors has it that the Carly Simon song, You’re So Vain was actually referring to the actor himself. The couple who met on the set of Bugsy in the beginning of the 90’s, tied the knot in 1992. Warren Beatty – Annette Bening | Now After 25 years of marriage and against all Hollywood odds, Warren Beatty and Annette Bening are still going strong. The couple share four children and are still hitting the red carpets looking more beautiful and happier than ever. The actor was quoted earlier this year saying “The most important thing that’s ever happened — the best thing that’s ever happened to me — was Annette and having four kids.”\\n\\nPaul Newman – Joanne Woodward | Then The Oscar winner met his second wife, Joanne, after he ended his marriage to Jackie Witte that lasted 11 years. The two met in 1953 and later shared their talents on the set of The Long Hot Summer. Indeed it was a very long and hot summer as the two married a year later. Paul was one of the hottest actors in his time, so we can only imagine the pressure on Joanne’s part of holding on to that one. Paul Newman – Joanne Woodward | Now The couple was considered one of the strongest power couples after their marriage lasted for 50 years until Paul sadly passed away in 2008. Paul and Joanne share three children, apart from the three kids that Paul has from his previous marriage. The couple is probably one of the favorite Hollywood couples in history as they really have been inseparable since the co starred in 1958. Their 50 year bond is a true romantic one and now that Joanne is sadly dealing with the Alzheimer’s disease, she slowly starts to forget all those beautiful memories.\\n\\nClint Eastwood – Maggie Johnson | Then What started as a blind date soon turned into marriage, when the actor and director, Eastwood married model Margaret Maggie Johnson in 1953 when he was only 23 years old. But the marriage between one of the more gorgeous men in Hollywood’s history, and his new wife, did not go all smooth and apparently looking good together was not enough for the two to stay together. Clint Eastwood – Maggie Johnson | Now Clint and Maggie’s marriage lasted 31 years and they had two children together, but eventually they separated in 1984. It didn’t come as a huge surprise as Clint was always considered to have a bit of a drifting look when it came to other women always and he even got another woman pregnant while being married to Maggie. The 84-year-old director and actor married his second wife Dina, but the two split and divorced after 17 years. The two have a daughter together, Morgan. Eastwood has two children with his first wife, Maggie Johnson, Kyle Eastwood and Alison Eastwood.\\n\\nElvis Presley – Priscilla Presley | Then You wouldn’t expect anything but an amazing love story from The King himself. When Elvis met Priscilla in 1959 she was only 14 years old. Elvis always had an eye for young women and simply fell head over heels for the sweet beauty. The lovebirds dated for seven years before they decided to marry in 1967 and then had had their daughter, Lisa Marie Presley just a few months later. But the marital bliss was not made to last for these two.\\n\\nElvis Presley – Priscilla Presley | Now These two’s love story and how it unfolded is probably one of the more publicized ones and we all know the rest. They divorced in 1973, but remained on pretty good terms and raised little Lisa together. Then in 1977, Elvis tragically passed away, only four years after the divorce – and left his young daughter without her legendary father by her side. Their daughter Lisa also pursued a career in music, but could never quite live up to her father’s status.\\n\\nWilliam Shatner – Elizabeth Shatner | Then The famous Star Trek star is probably mostly remembered by his role as Captain James T. Kirk. While he did stay committed to the successful franchise, his married life was somewhat more dynamic with no less than four marriages throughout his life. Elizabeth was Shatner’s fourth wife and the two tied the knot back in 2001. William had barely been single for the previous few decades, as he remarried pretty quickly after each divorce. But perhaps he hoped the fourth time would be the charm.\\n\\nWilliam Shatner -Elizabeth Shatner | Now William and Elizabeth is perhaps proof you should never give up on marriage, even if you have failed as many as three times. We guess the number four really is the lucky number, as William and Elizabeth are still going strong. Despite being married for close to 20 years they are still making public appearances on the red carpet, looking very happy together. Shatner has been quoted in the press saying that the fourth and last time, he made sure to pick right. He sure did.\\n\\nMichael Douglas – Diandra Luker | Then Before Douglas married the gorgeous Welsh actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, he was married to a woman called Diandra Luker for 23 years. The two however parted ways back in 1995, and as we all know Michale did find love yet again with Catherine. It definitely seems as if Michael is not afraid of big age gaps when it comes to love, as he married Diandra when she was just 19 and he was 32. The two share a son together named Cameron.\\n\\nMichael Douglas – Diandra Luker | Now The couple’s divorce may have left a few broken hearts, but one happy bank account when Diandra walked away with $45 million. That’s a pretty good deal for a newly single lady. And if Diandra had been careful to avoid the spotlight before the divorce, she did it even more once she was no longer married to one of Hollywood’s most famous actors. Douglas famously remarried Catherine Zeta-Jones and the two are still happily married, raising two children together.\\n\\nMichael Caine – Shakira Caine | Then Although the Batman actor is now quite recognized for his romantic roles, he sure did manage to be romantic when he married his wife, Shakira, a Guyanese actress in 1973. The two come from different backgrounds and religions, but that has never been an issue for the couple. Michael Caine – Shakira Caine | Now After 43 years of marriage, the two are still happily married and the two time Oscar winner, who is 82 today, tells that the secret to their long and happy marriage is having their own space. The actor and his wife who is a fashion designer have figured out the code to a happy life together: “The secret of a good marriage is two bathrooms. You never want to share a bathroom with a woman or you end up with a little corner for your shaving things and stuff. I am older than she is and I need more space.”\\n\\nRobert De Niro – Diahnne Abbott | Then The Taxi Driver actor married the actress and singer, Diahnne Abbott in 1976 and just by the look on his face you can tell he did not have a care in the world. The young couple was a couple who sure did know how to party right. Robert De Niro – Diahnne Abbott | Now After 12 years of marriage, the two divorced in 1988. De Niro has had quite a few relationships since then, one of them was with model, Toukie Smith. These days Robert is married to Grace Hightower while Diahnne has led a low key life away from the spotlight.\\n\\nSean Penn – Madonna | Then It was a definite big surprise when these two got hitched in 1985. The stars, each in their own career, were married for four years and pretty much left many heads turning everywhere they went and every red carpet they hit. Penn and Madonna’s union in marriage is one for the books. Sean Penn – Madonna | Now Needless to mention that the two megastars are still very successful in their careers. Penn is acting and directing and had remarried Robin Wright. The two have two children. Madonna is probably the most successful female artist of all time. She has been married to British director, Guy Ritchie but the two divorced in 2008 after eight years of marriage.\\n\\nPierce Brosnan – Keely Shaye Smith | Then The hunky actor is mostly famous for his roles in The Fourth Protocol, Cold War and Mrs. Doubtfire. Brosnan was married to his first wife. Cassandra Harris, for 11 years, until she sadly passed away. The actor spoke about his late wife: ‘Cassie was very positive about life. I mean, she had the most amazing energy and outlook on life. It was and is a terrible loss, and I see it reflected, from time to time, in my children.’ Three years after she passed away, Brosnan met Keely Shaye Smith and the two fell in love. Pierce Brosnan – Keely Shaye Smith | Now Brosnan and Keely married in 2001 and are still together. While it took some time for the actor to remarry after his former wife’s death, he eventually came to terms with his loss and moved on. They are a vey active couple when it comes to animal rights and the environment.\\n\\nSean Connery – Micheline Roquebrune | Then The legendary Bond actor met his future (second) wife, Micheline at a golf tournament in Morocco. Micheline, a Moroccan-French painter and the actor married in a secret ceremony in Casablanca in 1975. They seemed like a very chic couple who just fit each other perfectly when they shared some similar interests and passions. Connery was actually the first actor to ever play the famous secret agent and has starred in seven of the film series, which made him even more attractive to his wife at the time.\\n\\nSean Connery – Micheline Roquebrune | Now Connery was once quoted saying about his wife, “what more could a man want than a beautiful wife who not only understands golf but encourages you to play?” The two are still married and are still looking great. Sean, who has already retired from acting after a long and prosperous career, is now a devoted grandfather to his cute grandchildren. The legendary actor was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000, a very honorable title which makes us love him even more.\\n\\nTiger Woods – Elin Nordegren | Then Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren became engaged in 2003 after meeting at The Open Championship in 2001 through a mutual friend. The professional golfer and the Swedish model were married in 2004 in Orlando, Florida and bought a property on Jupiter Island the following year. Tiger and Elin had their first child in 2007, a daughter named Sam. In 2009, just before the couple’s infamous scandal would break out, Elin gave birth to their second child, Charlie Axel.\\n\\nTiger Woods – Elin Nordegren | Now In 2010, Tiger and Elin filed for divorce on the heels of a major public scandal. Tiger’s string of extra-marital affairs made the headline news and Elin reacted in a rather dramatic manner (she swung Tiger’s golf club at him in their driveway, if you can recall). Although Tiger has been labeled as a “serial cheater,” the pro-golfer and his ex-wife have managed to co-parent their two children in the friendliest of ways. In 2016, Elin graduated with top honors from Rollins College with a degree in psychology and Tiger made his return to the sport he once excelled at. And Elin has definitely moved on, as she is now expecting a baby with her boyfriend of two years, former NFL star Jordan Cameron.\\n\\nHarrison Ford – Calista Flockhart | Then Apart from their 22 year gap, the celebrity couple has enjoyed, or not quite, many separation rumors and voices that claimed that their marriage would never last. The two met in 2002 at the Golden Globe Awards ceremony, and after a long seven year relationship the couple got engaged in 2009 until they finally tied the knot in 2010. Ever since their union there was nothing but PDA for these two lovebirds. Calista is Ford’s third wife. The two adopted their son, Liam in 2011. Harrison Ford – Calista Flockhart | Now Calista and Ford are still married and are still attending the red carpet events together looking very much in love. The 74 year old actor has had a very busy year with the Star Wars film: The Force Awakens film. He was also cast to play in the upcoming film Blade Runner 2049 that is set to be released in 2017. Calista, who is mostly famous for her Ally McBeal role is still starring on the small screen on the series, Supergirl as Cat Grant.\\n\\nJohn Travolta – Kelly Preston | Then In Hollywood there is no better way to meet than on the set of a movie. That was the case for the Grease actor and Kelly Preston who met when they starred on The Experts in 1987. The two married four years later in two different ceremonies – a legal one and one conducted by their shared faith. John Travolta – Kelly Preston | Now The actor couple is still going strong and are staying together despite being in the public eye for all these years. Perhaps what has saved them is their private lifestyle. John and Kelly had three children together. But their son, Jett, sadly died in 2009 when he was only 16. The two are still happily married and their red carpet moments are priceless.\\n\\nJohnny Depp – Lori Anne Allison | Then Having the reputation of a bad boy in Hollywood, it’s hard to imagine Johnny Depp has already settled down for the first time when he was 20 years old. His first marriage was to Lori Ann Allison in 1983 from whom he divorced from two years later. Lori was a make up artist and we guess they met on a movie set. Johnny Depp – Lori Anne Allison | Now As we all know, Depp has been in two very high profile relationships since his divorce from Lori Anne. His first relationship to Vanessa Paradi ended after fourteen years after the couple had two children together. His second infamous marriage was to Amber Heard with whom he is now in the process of a very ugly divorce. Lori has been under the radar since she divorced Depp, but she did show her support for her ex husband during his publicized divorce from Amber Heard, saying he would never lay a hand on a woman after the actor was accused of domestic violence.\\n\\nJeremy Irons – Sinéad Cusck | Then The British actor who had his big film debut when he starred in the 1981 romantic drama, The French Lieutenant’s Woman, married the Irish actress, Sinéad Cusak in 1978. The couple has had a very successful career since they met. The two have two sons named Sam and Max. Irons’ first marriage was to Julie Hallam, and so Cusak was actually his second wife. Jeremy Irons – Sinéad Cusck | Now It has been 38 years since these two tied the knot, and the long time lovebirds are still happily married. This forever after case cannot be taken for granted in Hollywood. It’s truly heartwarming to know that there are some still power couples left in Tinsel Town, and that even in this industry filled with non stop cheating scandals, real love does indeed exist.\\n\\nAnthony Hopkins – Jennifer Leyton | Then Sir Anthony, the Hannibal star married Jennifer Leyton in 1972 after he split from his first wife, Petronella. The couple used to appear on the red carpet a lot and were a very stable couple throughout the years. And in fact they never had any children together. Abigail Hopkins is Anthony’s daughter from his first wife. Anthony Hopkins – Jennifer Leyton | Now The couple who was once going strong split in 2002 after almost 30 years of marriage after they had been living separately for the last two years of their marriage. The Welsh actor has been romantically linked to many women including Joyce Ingalls and Francine Kay. Jenni admitted that separating from Hopkins was a very difficult thing to do and she was quoted: “I don’t find it an easy state….If I’ve got any choice, I don’t want a divorce.” After their divorce they went their separate ways, Anthony remarried and moved to LA and Jennifer remained home in the UK.\\n\\nBruce Springsteen – Juliana Phillips | Then Th Born In The USA singer, also nicknamed the Boss, married Juliana in 1985. Phillips was a model and a successful actress back in the day and was famous for her role as Frankie Reed on the television series, Sisters. The singer and the model were one of the most attractive couples Hollywood has ever known. Bruce Springsteen – Juliana Phillips | Now Their romance ended after four years, but the couple did enjoy their celebrity life and had no children together. Phillips was always known for being the “girlfriend of” of the good looking musician. Their dirty laundry was even mentioned in Bruce’s 1987 Tunnel of Love album where he mentioned a lot of the unhappiness they were experiencing. Phillips sure does look amazing today.\\n\\nMichael J. Fox – Tracy Pollan | Then Who knew that co starring on a show named Family Ties would set the stage for forming a real family. Michael and Tracy, who met on the set of the American sitcom back in the 80’s married a few years later. Tracy actually played Fox’s on screen girlfriend but the two only began dating when they costarred once again on Bright Lights. Michael J. Fox – Tracy Pollan | Now Back to the future, the year is 2016 and the good looking couple is still happily married! It seems like there is nothing these two can’t overcome after Tracy has been and still is by her husband’s side through his struggle with Parkinson’s Disease. The couple has four children and Michael, despite his harsh symptoms, is starring on his show, The Michael J Fox Show.\\n\\nJeff Bridges – Susan Geston | Then The Big Lebowski star and one of Hollywood’s leading men, met Susan Geston in 1974 when he was filming a movie called Rancho Delux. Susan was a waitress where the film was shooting. It was almost like love at first sight for the two and just five days after Bridges proposed, the two tied the knot in 1977. Jeff Bridges – Susan Geston | Now We can’t say we’re surprised to find out that the lovely couple is still together and going strong. They have three daughters and are still looking very much in love. Needless to say that they are both still easy on the eyes. The Oscar winner even mentioned his lovely wife in his winning speech saying ”I especially want to thank my gorgeous wife, Sue. We’ve been married 33 years. We have a beautiful family, three girls, Isabelle, Jessie and Haley. Thank you guys, I wouldn’t be up here without you.”\\n\\nBruce Willis – Demi Moore | Then Considered one of Hollywood’s most famous couples, Bruce and Demi met when they attended the premiere of Stakeout. The actor couple tied the knot in 1987 and had three daughters together. The three girls, Rumer, Scout and Tallulah are famous today not just for being the famous couple’s girls. Although the celebrity couple decided to go their separate ways in 2000, they are still very close friends, so close that they were invited to each other’s second weddings. Bruce Willis – Demi Moore | Now Demi was actually married once to Freddy Moore in 1980 and so Bruce was her second husband, while Demi was the actor’s first wife. There’s no doubt that these two set a very good example for other celebrity couples who sadly decided to divorce, with the kind and respectful way they treat each other. Bruce is married these days to model, Emma Hemming. Demi married actor Ashton Kutcher in 2005, and although the pair seemed strong and like another power couple, the two divorced in 2013.\\n\\nMel Gibson – Robyn Moore | Then The Braveheart star did not always have the bad reputation that he is known for today and in fact led a pretty normal family life when he married his actress wife, Robyn Moore in 1980 after the two met after the release of the first Mad Max film in 1977. When Gibson met Robyn she was a dental nurse an the two have seven kids together. Yes, seven children and that doesn’t include Gibson’s other two kids. Mel Gibson – Robyn Moore | Now The Aussie couple has unfortunately gone their separate ways after 31 years and it seems like their long and strong relationship went downhill after Gibson was arrested for driving under the influence in 2006. Although there were hopes for the future for the Hollywood couple, their relationship ended but remained considerably friendly due to the seven kids they share. Robyn reportedly walked out of the long marriage with a whooping fortune of £250 million, just enough to get a fresh start.\\n\\nMark Hamill – Marilou York | Then Mostly recognized for his role as Luke Skywalker, the Star Wars star married dental hygienist, Marilou York in 1978, but the road to saying their I Do’s had known some ups and downs. The couple has three children. One of their children, Nathan, who was born while the production of The Empire Strikes Back, made an appearance in the Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace when he played the role of the Royal Guards of Naboo. Mark Hamill – Marilou York | Now The couple who got married in 1978 in a private ceremony is still together and is still looking fabulous on the red carpet with their family. The actor who has had a few personal bumps in his life including the time he was seriously injured in a car crash, has grown stronger and is now a happy man with a very hyped up social media account.\\n\\nChuck Norris – Gena O’Kelley | Then Learning from past mistakes, the martial art professional and the Walker, Texas Ranger actor decided that next time around will be a better one. Norris met his second wife, former model and deputy sheriff in California, Gena O’Kelley, in Dallas in 1997. Their friendship grew into a loving relationship. When he met Gena, the actor was 58 while she was only 30 years old. The couple has twins, a boy and a girl. Chuck Norris – Gena O’Kelley | Now The couple is still married and they live happily with their blended families. Gena has two kids from her previous marriage and Chuck has three other children apart from their twins; one child of which was born out of an extramarital affair. The happy couple have a couple of homes in the South, including a ranch close to Houston.\\n\\nRichard Dreyfuss – Jeramie Rain | Then The Oscar winner who won an Academy Award for his role in the 1977 The Goodbye Girl met actress and producer, Jeramie Rain when she was 34 in the beginning of the 80’s and had three children together. Sadly, their oldest son was born with an unusual genetic eye disorder which left him blind. Richard Dreyfuss – Jeramie Rain | Now Although the couple has had to face some tough situations while being married and you would think they would get them closer together, the couple ended up getting divorced in 1995. Since then Dreyfuss remarried but got divorced again. Rain was diagnosed with systemic lupus when she was 28 and today she is the founder of a charity for children who are diagnosed with the same disease.\\n\\nSylvester Stallone – Brigitte Nielsen | Then The action movie star who is famous for his roles as Rocky Balboa and Rambo married the Danish model and actress on December 15, 1985. The two actors met when Stallone was at the peak of his career. Nielsen also appeared in the Rocky IV movie as well as Beverly Hills Cop. Sylvester Stallone – Brigitte Nielsen | Now The marriage between the good looking actor couple ended after only two years and their breakup was highly covered by the press. Nielsen was Stallone’s second wife and the actor married for the third time in 1997 and now has three daughters. Brigitte, who was also infamously known for her affair with fellow actor Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was still married, has had some television appearances on the Italian and Swedish television. She has been married five times in total and is married to day to Mattia Dessi and the two live in Palm Springs.\\n\\nRichard Gere – Cindy Crawford | Then The good looking actor sure did date some pretty women before he starred in the 1990 hit movie. Gere started dating supermodel Cindy Crawford when she was only 21 and when the two had a big age difference. T hey were probably one of Hollywood’s most attractive couples of all time. The couple got married in 1991 and when they attended the red carpet they looked like they were taken out of a magazine. Richard Gere – Cindy Crawford | Now After four years of marriage, the couple divorced in 1995. Gere remarried model Carey Lowell and they have a son. They separated after 11 years. The former supermodel is looking as beautiful as always. She married a fellow model named Rande Gerber in 1998 and the two have two very attractive children. Their daughter Kaia is pursuing her modeling career these days.\\n\\nMichael York – Patricia McCallum | Then The 74 year old actor who has had an impressive career in film and in television, met photographer, Patricia McCallum when she was hired to take his pictures in 1967. The two got married a year later on York’s 26th birthday, and would prove to be yet another successful Hollywood match. Michael York – Patricia McCallum | Now The couple who got married in 1967 is still together and are looking very happy. They still arrive on the red carpets looking sharp and gorgeous. They have one son, Rick McCallum, the Star Wars producer, who is actually York’s step son. The actor announced in 2013 that he was diagnosed with amyloidosis, but having his wife to support him makes him stronger as each day goes by.\\n\\nTim Allen – Laura Diebel | Then The comedy actor met Laura Diebel when he was doing his Bachelor’s degree in television and radio production at Western Michigan University. Allen married Diebel in 1984 at a tricky time in his life when he was selling illegal substances despite his personal and professional success. Tim Allen – Laura Diebel | Now The couple did not stand the test of time and in 1999 they separated after they had one daughter together. His rocky life was filled with ups and downs. In 1997 he had another bump when he was charged with driving under the influence but was doing great on his series, Home Improvement and on the Toy Story movie.\\n\\nJeff Goldblum – Geena Davis | Then It is known that when working together for many hours on set and spending so much in each other’s company, fly sparks and romances may hit. We guess that was the case for Jeff and Geena who got married in 1987 after they worked on three different films together. Jeff Goldblum – Geena Davisl | Now These two cannot be more apart from each other these days. Geena, who was the actor’s second wife turned to the small screen and you could see her extraordinary performance on season 11 of Grey’s Anatomy. Jeff on the other hand continued with this successful career and was in charge of the comic spin off of the Jurassic Park series.\\n\\nKelsey Grammer – Camille Grammer | Then The Frasier star himself married the model in 1997 and it seems like their marriage was doomed from the get go since the two had a very nasty divorce that was finalized in 2011. We hope this didn’t effect their two children too badly. Kelsey Grammer – Camille Grammer | Now Just like many stars do these days, Camille turned to reality television when she was part of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills on the franchise’s eleventh season. Kelsey went on to appear on television as well as in film, and some of his film work includes X-Men: The Last Stand and The Expendables 3.\\n\\nColin Firth – Livia Giuggioli | Then The British actor married Livia in 1997, soon after he split from his long time partner of five years, Meg Tilly. Colin and Livia have two sons named Luca and Matteo. Colin Firth – Livia Giuggioli | Now It’s lovely to see that Firth and his wife are still going string and they are happily married. It’s hard to miss Colin as he is one of the busiest actors in Hollywood. His outstanding performance on the 2010 biographical movie, The King’s Speech even won the British actor an Oscar as well as other important words.\\n\\nAntonio Banderas – Melanie Griffith | Then We guess the sparks that flew on the film that they co starred together were just Too Much for the these two to handle that they had to act on their love. Antonio and Melanie, who met in 1995 married the following year and that was actually the second time around for Banderas. Their love was so passionate that Griffith even tattooed her husband’s name on her body. Antonio Banderas – Melanie Griffith | Now These two lovebirds were one of Hollywood’s strongest couples for years, but unfortunately they divorced in 2015. Their divorce left many people in complete shock. They have one daughter named Stella Banderas.\\n\\nAlec Baldwin – Kim Basinger | Then Another fashionable power couple was Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin who met in 1990 when they co starred on The Marrying Man. The two actually got married three years later and they have one daughter, Ireland Baldwin, who seems to be following in her parent’s footsteps. Alec Baldwin – Kim Basinger | Now Baldwin and Basinger split in 2002, and they both moved on since then. Alec married Hilaria Thomas in 2012 and the two have three children together. Kim will have a very sassy role in the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey film.\\n\\nRobert Downey Jr. – Deborah Falconer | Then He was always considered as a Hollywood bad boy, and that could explain his rash decision to marry Falconer after only 42 days. They must have done something right as the two were married for 12 years until they divorced in 2004. Their divorce was blamed a lot on the actor’s drinking problems. Robert Downey Jr. – Deborah Falconer | Now After the two got divorced, Robert quickly found himself in a new relationship and he married Susan Downey in 2005. Robert is doing very well in his personal life as he’s been sober for quite some time now, as well as with his career. His latest performance was on the hit film, Iron Man.\\n\\nAndre Agassi – Brook Shields | Then Brooke Shields and Andra Agassi were married from 1997 until 1999. The professional tennis player and the actress had a turbulent marriage – Agassi was using illegal substances for the majority of their relationship and it eventually took a toll on their union. When Booke suggested that they go to couples counseling, to develop their communication skills and help Andre into recovery, he refused. Brooke filed for divorce soon after, but still considers Andre to be a good human deep down. At the time he would have done anything for his wife and her, in return. Andre Agassi – Brook Shields | Now Today, Brooke became the successful actress we all know and love, and Andre has since retired, although, he released a tell-all memoir in 2009. Brooke wasn’t a fan of the autobiography, but she did sit with her ex-husband’s ghost-writer to get the most pivotal points of their marriage depicted correctly. Brooke doesn’t feel that she was as poorly portrayed as she had initially expected, but the past partners aren’t necessarily close friends now, either.\\n\\nGary Oldman – Uma Thurman | Then Oldman and Thurman met when they were both playing in the 1990’s action movie, State of Grace. What started as love at first sight soon ended after only two years. That was actually Gary’s second time around while it was Uma’s first.

              " 'On this list you\\'ll find the best PC games we\\'re playing right now—recent singleplayer hits, thriving esports, and a few modern classics that would improve any library. We\\'ll continue to update this list as new games release, removing older favorites and replacing them with our latest obsessions. Rather than an ever-expanding list that reaches deep into the past, we\\'re shooting for a practical answer to the question: \\'What new PC game should I get?\\'\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a more comprehensive list which includes our favorite games from the past few decades, check out our yearly Top 100 list or our list of the most important PC games. For an up-to-date look at upcoming games, we\\'ve assembled the new games of 2020. For free options, check out the best free games on Steam and best free browser games.\\n\\nNeed a new system to play these games on? You can build an entry-level gaming PC for around $750, or our recommended mid-range PC for $1,000. If you want something that works out of the box, we also recommend some pre-built PCs.\\n\\nThe best games of 2020 so far\\n\\nSeven games have joined the exclusive 90%-and-up PC Gamer review score club so far this year. Here they are, the best of the best in 2020:\\n\\nCrusader Kings 3 (94%)\\n\\n\"Crusader Kings 3 is incredible,\" said Fraser in his review of the new medieval grand strategy game and family drama generator. \"I can\\'t imagine being done with it.\"\\n\\nFactorio (91%)\\n\\nThe factory-building game is finally out of Early Access, and it\\'s brilliant. A \"stupendously intricate mechanical cake,\" as we put it in our review.\\n\\nHalf-Life: Alyx (92%)\\n\\nIt isn\\'t Half-Life 3, and it\\'s VR only, but it\\'s one of the best VR games you can buy, so if you\\'ve got a headset it\\'s a must have.\\n\\nSuper Mega Baseball 3 (90%)\\n\\nIt\\'s the best baseball game on PC, and helped get us through the sportsless times.\\n\\nDoom Eternal (94%)\\n\\nHigh-tempo demon slaying that\\'ll make you sweat. It might take an hour or so to click, but when it does it\\'s better than the 2016 reboot.\\n\\nValorant (90%)\\n\\nIt can\\'t be called original—it\\'s Counter-Strike, but different—but Riot\\'s free-to-play shooter is still the year\\'s best new competitive game.\\n\\nParadise Killer (91%)\\n\\nThe zany vaporwave world might be a bit much for some, but the sleuthing is good. One of the best detective games you can play.\\n\\nBelow are more of the games we\\'ve liked most so far this year, excluding the 90% and up games above. See our reviews section for even more recommendations.\\n\\nCall of Duty has gone battle royale again with Warzone, but this time it\\'s free-to-play and one of the best new battle royale games of the year (along with Fall Guys). Apex Legends remains good, too, and Fortnite is obviously going strong as always. And, as mentioned above, if you\\'re tired of the battle royale scene, the excellent and free-to-play Valorant updates Counter-Strike\\'s 5v5 plant and defuse matches with modern frills like character abilities.\\n\\nFor singleplayer action and adventure try Mortal Shell (Dark Souls-ey) or former PS4 exclusive Horizon Zero Dawn. In the RPG department, we recommend befriending a cyborg chicken in Wasteland 3 or playing JRPG classic Persona 4 Golden, which came to PC earlier this year.\\n\\nIn the strategy department, Total War Saga: Troy is pretty good, and both Gears Tactics and XCOM: Chimera Squad are worth a play, with Gears surprisingly being the more interesting of them. WWI mech game Iron Harvest is also quite good.\\n\\nWe also recommend going for a peaceful fly in Microsoft Flight Simulator, which is fantastic, if a little buggy (it\\'s on Xbox Game Pass, if you have that).\\n\\nOur favorite games of 2019\\n\\nAbove, you\\'ll find a list of some of our favorite games of 2019, not all of which received one of our GOTY Awards, but all of which we recommend (listed in no particular order). We think just about anyone can get something out of these games (except for maybe Final Fantasy 14: Shadowbringers, which is fantastic but also requires the commitment to play through a hell of a lot of Final Fantasy 14).\\n\\nBelow, you\\'ll find recommendations for other recent and older games we love.\\n\\nCompetitive online games\\n\\nApex Legends\\n\\nReleased: 2019 | Developer: Respawn | Origin | Our review\\n\\nApex Legends is the best battle royale game available now. The map is fantastic, the \\'ping\\' communication system is something every FPS should have from here on, the guns and movement are great fun (no wallrunning, but sliding down hills feels great), and it\\'s free-to-play with nothing to pay for except cosmetics. It isn\\'t the game we expected from Respawn, but we\\'re glad it\\'s here. Check James\\' review for more.\\n\\n(Image credit: Riot Games)\\n\\nValorant\\n\\nReleased: 2020 | Developer: Riot | Official site | Our review\\n\\nValorant is Riot\\'s take on CS:GO, and it\\'s very similar. It\\'s played in a series of quick rounds which sees one team attempt to plant a bomb while the other tries to stop them or defuse it, and it\\'s all about communication, intel, mind games, and mechanically challenging shooting. But Valorant successfully adds character abilities to that design sheet, which introduces new possibilities for surprise tactics and delightful skill shots. It also adds a bunch of quality of life improvements. Newcomers to CS-style FPS will have a lot to learn, but Valorant is a ton of fun in a supportive group.\\n\\nRainbow Six Siege\\n\\nReleased: 2015 | Developer: Ubisoft Montreal | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nCounter-Strike\\'s sexier cousin. Siege might lack the sharp hit detection and purity of CS:GO, but it\\'s a more accessible and modern FPS that rewards clever timing and coordinated teamwork as much as aim. Siege\\'s learning curve is a result of all the stuff (characters, gadgets, elaborate maps, and guns) that\\'s been added since December 2015, but eventually you find yourself picking operators, map spots, and roles that you\\'re comfortable with. Ubisoft continues to support Siege, dropping four major updates per year along with regular fixes.\\n\\nOverwatch\\n\\nReleased: 2016 | Developer: Blizzard | Battle.net | Our review\\n\\nWith Overwatch\\'s colorful characters and bright, inclusive world, Blizzard brought the world of team-based hero shooters to an entirely new market. Teams of six take the roles of tank, DPS, and healer to battle over objectives, not just who can get the most kills. It\\'s a game that rewards—if not requires—teamwork. And with a growing cast of now 27 heroes to choose from, there\\'s a character to fit just about any play style.\\n\\nFortnite Battle Royale\\n\\nReleased: 2017 | Developer: Epic | Official site | Free-to-play | Our review\\n\\nWhat started as a sterile PUBG imitation has evolved into the Minecraft generation’s arena shooter. Fortnite’s building system rewards good aim and an eye for architecture equally, extending battle royale shootouts from green pastures to impromptu skyscrapers slapped together in a minute. With ridiculously frequent updates from Epic Games that introduce new weapons, traps, tools, and skins, Fortnite is easily worth the price of admission, and even then, worth the time it takes to master such an obtuse, irregular building system.\\n\\nPlayerUnknown\\'s Battlegrounds\\n\\nReleased: 2017 | Developer: PUBG Corp. | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\n100 murderous hopefuls skydive onto an abandoned island, grab whatever weapons and ammo they can find, and fight to the death. Rinse and repeat. Though the concept wasn\\'t new (PlayerUnknown himself is responsible for multiple battle royale modes and mods), PUBG made the battle royale genre into the phenomenon that it is today. As a third- or first-person shooter, PUBG is more realistic and less arcadey than Fortnite. The joy of it is how it forces players to move and take risks as an ever-shrinking forcefield funnels surviving players toward each other until a winner climbs out of the wreckage. Every instant of every game is a flood of important decisions to make, and any one of them—even a minor one—could lead to your doom.\\n\\nRocket League\\n\\nReleased: 2015 | Developer: Psyonix | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nThe best and only synthesis of hockey and soccer than you can play with rocket-powered battle cars. Where most esports rely on gunplay or clicky top-down wizardry, Rocket League is all physics and speed. Simply put, you\\'re trying to smash a giant soccer ball into a goal with a car. But the cars can jump, and flip, and fly into the air once you get the hang of it (which will take a while). Even after three years, Rocket League players are still inventing new moves and tricks—if there\\'s a skill ceiling, no one\\'s bumped it yet. It\\'s intimidating and your first matches will probably be rough as you learn to steer and backflip and ride the walls, but since there are so many other new players at any given time, as well as training modes and bot matches, you can still get up to speed even if you\\'re entering the arena late. Note that while you can play Rocket League with a mouse and keyboard, and some good players do, most prefer a controller.\\n\\nHearthstone\\n\\nReleased: 2014 | Developer: Blizzard | Official site\\n\\nDespite the departure of game director Ben Brode, he of the flannel shirt and megaton laughter, Hearthstone remains in relatively rude health. The game\\'s last two expansions—The Boomsday Project (August 2018) and Rastakhan\\'s Rumble (Devember 2018)—have rightly been criticised for failing to freshen the meta sufficiently, but nonethless it\\'s possible to build a deck with any class and pilot it successfully on the ladder. Those looking to try-hard on a budget should consider Spell Hunter, which is relatively cheap to build, whilst those looking to make instant enemies may prefer the ultra aggressive Odd Paladin, which remains obnoxious despite a recent nerf. For those of you with ladder anxiety, Hearthstone also now includes a rich suite of single-player content in the Solo Adventures section. There you\\'ll find Rumble Run, Puzzle Lab, Monster Hunt and Dungeon Run—plenty of fun, without the pressure of a turn timer.\\n\\nLeague of Legends\\n\\nReleased: 2009 | Developer: Riot Games | Official site\\n\\nMOBAs are hard, rewarding competitive games because they demand teamwork, quick reaction times, and knowledge of beginning, middle, and endgame phases that vary with the role you play. And if you\\'re going to play one, LoL is the best place to start. League of Legends has had remarkable staying power as one of the most popular games in esports for a couple simple reasons. One, it strikes just the right balance of depth and approachability for a MOBA. A gargantuan roster of heroes means you could spend years learning the ins-and-outs of the game, but mechanically it\\'s less demanding than Dota 2, and more involved than Heroes of the Storm. Two, Riot Games hasn\\'t been afraid to make significant changes to the map, characters, and other systems over the years, so there\\'s always something new to learn.\\n\\nIf you can, play with a team of friends—it\\'s far more fun (and effective) to coordinate on a headset than deal with randoms over text chat. If you bounce off of LoL, Dota 2 is of course extremely popular as well, and both are free-to-play, so give it a shot.\\n\\nBattlefield 1 and Battlefield 5\\n\\nReleased: 2016/2018 | Developer: DICE\\n\\nWhile Battlefield 1 diehards insist that it\\'s the superior game, we recommend both BF1 and BF5. On BF5\\'s side, EA has done away with paid seasons passes, and is releasing all new maps free, plus there\\'s a battle royale mode now.\\n\\nMeanwhile, though, Battlefield 1 is included with Origin Access (both Basic and Premium) and is pretty cheap otherwise, so if the World War 1 setting appeals to you, it\\'s a low-cost entry into the series.\\n\\nHere\\'s our Battlefield 1 review, and our Battlefield 5 review.\\n\\nSingleplayer and co-op shooters\\n\\nDoom Eternal\\n\\nReleased:2020| Developer: id Software| Steam | Our review\\n\\nThe original Doom—back in 1993—is the most influential shooter of all time. With a pedigree like that, 2016\\'s Doom reboot could have coasted by on the family name, had some fun, and called it a day. Instead, Doom surprised us all by being a spectacular shooter in its own right. More than that, Doom abandoned a lot of the storytelling conventions and cutscenes we\\'ve come to associate with modern games: about 30 seconds into the first level, the main character physically throws the plot across the room and shoots a demon in the face. Doom has a singular purpose, and if you\\'re not a gun or a demon\\'s face, it doesn\\'t care to know you.\\n\\nDoom Eternal, meanwhile, goes hog wild with lore, but manages to remain amazing. It\\'s one of the most demanding shooters we\\'ve ever played—read our full review for more on why it\\'s even better than Doom, and a must-play.\\n\\nWarhammer: Vermintide 2\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Fatshark | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nLike Vermintide 1, Vermintide 2 takes on the format of Valve\\'s classic co-op shooter, Left 4 Dead. Each hero is generally capable but vulnerable on their own. Among the swarms of rats are elite enemies that specialize in ambushing individual players, leaving them helpless until a comrade rescues them. The mutual need for protection makes Vermintide unusually dependent on good teamwork, and sharp spatial awareness and generous instincts are better for survival than perfect aim.\\n\\nThere are five heroes to play, and each has three subclasses and a long list of possible weapons and specialty skills. Every successful mission rewards players with random weapons and loot, and a surprisingly deep crafting system helps players customize their heroes. Random matchmaking to find groups is fine, but Vermintide 2 is a real joy when played with friends, like a corporate team-building exercise with swords and axes.\\n\\nDusk\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: David Szymanski | Humble Store, Steam\\n\\nIf you have any nostalgia for DOS-era shooters like Doom and Quake, Dusk has got it all: finding color-coded keys and secret chambers, a metal soundtrack, and high-speed strafing with dual-wielded shotguns while blasting the faces off of demons. An ideal way to spend an afternoon. Check out our Dusk review for more.\\n\\nResident Evil 2 (Remake)\\n\\nReleased: 2019 | Developer: Capcom | Steam | Our review\\n\\nA superb remake of the survival horror classic, with a mix of nostalgia and newness that Andy called \"tense, challenging, and beautiful\" in his review.\\n\\nAction games\\n\\nGrand Theft Auto 5\\n\\nReleased: 2015 | Developer: Rockstar North | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nGTA 5 runs beautifully on PC, and its open world is still the best of any game, a gorgeous sprawl that replicates everything we associate with Los Angeles: the flat heat, the atmosphere, the fact that the city is so damn big. The campaign is the series\\' best ever, punctuated by ambitious heist missions involving all three protagonists. It\\'s a lot of fun to spend time in this world.\\n\\nIf you want to take things further, GTA Online is waiting for you with an absolute ton of stuff to do. Not all of it is amazing, but with a few friends, it\\'s great fun to knock through the Online mode\\'s bespoke heists, and owning a business feels pretty cool too. There are plenty of ways to play this game forever, including all of these great mods.\\n\\nAssassin\\'s Creed Odyssey\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Ubisoft Montreal | Steam | Our review\\n\\nUbisoft nailed the latest in the Assassin\\'s Creed series, fully embracing the roleplaying genre and retooling its typical open world to-do list into an adventure full of quests worth doing—all set in its grandest world to date.\\n\\nDishonored 2\\n\\nReleased: 2016 | Developer: Arkane Studios | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nThe best immersive sim around, with sprawling, complicated levels that are wonderful to unpack, as well as a couple of high-concept missions that you\\'ll never forget. It\\'s like Arkane made a sequel based on how much everyone loved Lady Boyle\\'s Last Party in Dishonored—most of the levels here are just as good. The option to play as two characters, with their own version of the story and sets of powers, offers even more replay value.\\n\\nCrucially, too, Dishonored 2 offers more non-lethal ways to play if you\\'re not a perfect stealth player. Being able to block enemy sword attacks, get them into a chokehold, shove them over then boot them in the face, knocking them out, is the best fun. Likewise, using Emily\\'s domino ability to knock out multiple enemies at once feels incredibly empowering. And that\\'s just one of many ways you can play.\\n\\nHitman 2\\n\\nReleased: 2018| Developer: IO Interactive| Steam | Our review\\n\\nAgent 47 has been taking contracts and knocking off targets in games for almost 20 years, but the latest in the series is his best work yet. What\\'s extra great about Hitman 2 is that if you didn\\'t play the previous Hitman reboot (also great), you can purchase upgraded versions of all of its levels. And if you do own 2016\\'s Hitman, you can have those for free. For more on why we love Hitman\\'s latest incarnations, head to our 2018 award for Best Stealth Game.\\n\\nAction and turn-based RPGs\\n\\nNier: Automata\\n\\nReleased: 2017 | Developer: Square Enix | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nThis offbeat action RPG focuses on extremely stylish androids who\\'ve been sent to Earth to make it safe for humans again by wiping out the dangerous machines that dominate the landscape. But the story isn\\'t as straightforward as that—and not all of the machines you face are brainless automatons. Some of them have hopes, dreams and orgies (!). The story in Automata is surprisingly fantastic, with multiple endings that change your perspective on your characters, and well-written sidequests.\\n\\nThis is one of those games that overreaches slightly, but is better for having done so. As an action game, it\\'s not quite Platinum\\'s best—that mantle still belongs to Bayonetta—but it\\'s still satisfying to batter robots with a big sword in washed out open world environments. A deserved cult hit, even if the game still hasn\\'t been properly patched on PC (there\\'s a fan mod that smooths out a few performance issues).\\n\\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\\n\\nReleased: 2015 | Developer: CD Projekt RED | GOG| Our review\\n\\nThe Witcher 3 follows Geralt, the world\\'s grumpiest monster-slaying bounty hunter, as he fights and magics his way across a medieval fantasy world. It tells a well-written, clever story, but more importantly, The Witcher 3 is the best open-world RPG you can explore right now (and quite possibly the best there\\'s ever been).\\n\\nThe Witcher 3 is great mostly because it\\'s so full of things to do. It\\'s a huge world chockablock with ghouls, vampires, and wraiths—and the people can be pretty nasty, too. The size and depth of the world gives every quest context, an anchor that feels like it stretches back into history. Investigating a haunted farmhouse, for example, turns up clues about the type of spectre involved. Choosing the right weapon and brewing up a special potion feel like steps in a centuries-old ceremony. The Witcher 3 is a triumph of worldbuilding.\\n\\nBesides the world, Geralt himself is the star of the show. He\\'s frequently dour and funny and jaded, and he\\'s an appealing character to spend time with. Some of the storylines will mean more to long-time fans of the Witcher books and games, but even without playing the earlier games in the Witcher series, The Witcher 3 is worth several hundred hours of your time.\\n\\nDivinity: Original Sin 2\\n\\nReleased: 2017 | Developer: Larian Studios | GOG, Steam | Our review\\n\\nA classic-style isometric RPG that feels completely modern, with four-player co-op, great characters, and super-challenging turn-based combat that makes heavy use of physical interactions: cast a rain spell to put out fires, for instance, or splash oil around to spread them. With big open areas, interlocking quests that can be completed in any order, disguises, status effects, and the freedom to whack any NPC you feel like, it\\'s worth putting up with a little wonkiness (which has been improved with the Definitive Edition update) to experience such a creative, freeform campaign. The writing and roleplaying are also top-notch, giving you a real emotional investment for a campaign that can easily stretch to the 100 hour mark.\\n\\nOS2 also includes built-in game master tools for running your own adventures, and separate, free mod tools that give you full access to the engine\\'s capabilities and all of the included assets.\\n\\nNi no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Level-5 | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nOne of the prettiest and most ambitious JRPGs on PC, Ni No Kuni 2 follows Evan Pettiwhisker Tildrum, a young half-cat king who sets out to build a peaceful new kingdom—and a new circle of friends—after his rightful crown is stolen from him. Ni No Kuni 2 channels Suikoden and Studio Ghibli, pairing an expansive open world with exciting realtime third-person combat, and grounding them in a satisfying kingdom building sim. Scout new citizens by visiting fantastical far-off kingdoms, earn better gear by tackling secret dungeons and minibosses, then bring everything back home to improve your own kingdom. The kingdom sim is enjoyable in its own right, and every other part of the game benefits from it, from exploration to combat. Ni No Kuni 2 is a cute fairytale wrapped in complex systems that connect in meaningful, interesting ways, and there\\'s not an ounce of fat on it.\\n\\nDark Souls 3\\n\\nReleased: 2016 | Developer: FromSoftware | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nWhat Dark Souls 3 lacks in originality—like the Souls games before it, it\\'s an action-RPG that takes you through a baroque, dying world filled with monsters and opaque storytelling—it makes up for in polish. It\\'s by far the smoothest of the series, gorgeous and stable on PC, and that translates to faster, more vicious enemies that will murder you without mercy. But you\\'re also a bit more nimble this time around, keeping the notorious Souls challenge intact but rarely feeling unfair. And like all the Souls games, there\\'s so much here if you plunge into the RPG depths: classes and magic systems, shortcuts and speedrun options, gear upgrading and NPC storylines to follow if you can make the right choices. Conquering Dark Souls 3 once will easily keep you busy for 50 hours, but if it gets its hooks in you, you could keep playing it for years.\\n\\nExploration, survival, and building games\\n\\nStardew Valley\\n\\nReleased: 2016 | Developer: ConcernedApe | GOG, Humble Store, Steam| Our review\\n\\nThe Harvest Moon farm-life sims used to be console-only. Then indie designer Eric Barone came along and made this tribute so we too can enjoy the pastoral fantasy of chicken ownership and mayonnaise profiteering. In Stardew Valley, you inherit a farm in the countryside and split your days between growing crops and befriending the locals, a colorful cast of eccentrics, some of whom can be romanced. You either get super serious about maximizing your income, creating the perfect grid of profitable crops for each season, or just potter about, taking the occasional fishing trip or delving into the monster mines as the mood takes you. An entire subgenre of farming/crafting sims with obligatory fishing minigames has sprung up in its wake, but Stardew Valley remains the best.\\n\\n(Image credit: https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3duql5/one_of_my_best_ksp_screenshots_decommissioning_a/)\\n\\nKerbal Space Program\\n\\nReleased: 2015 | Developer: Squad | GOG, Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nYou build a spacecraft, and fly it into space. Simple, right? Usually it\\'s not. A lot of things can go wrong as you\\'re constructing a vessel from Kerbal Space Program\\'s vast library of parts, almost always explosively so. But as you trial-and-error your way to a stable orbit, you start to unlock the full breadth of what Kerbal offers. You can build many different types of ship, and use them to edge further and further out into the solar system, enjoying your achievement as you contemplate the vast solitude of space. Kerbal Space Program is equal parts slapstick comedy and majestic exploration—incredibly silly, but evocative where it counts.\\n\\n(Image credit: Лимонная жёпа)\\n\\nSubnautica\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Unknown Worlds | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nDepending how you feel about diving, Subnautica can be either a wonderful opportunity to explore an alien aquarium or a straight-up horrorshow. Even with the survival stuff turned off so you don\\'t have to regularly grab fish and eat them as you swim past, its depths contain claustrophobic tunnels and beasts big enough to swallow you whole. The thing is, Subnautica works as both a tense survival game about making it day by day in a hostile alien ocean and a way to drift around meeting strange sea creatures (and eating them).\\n\\nMore building and survival games Factorio\\n\\nSurviving Mars\\n\\nRust\\n\\nSee our full list of the best survival games\\n\\nProteus\\n\\nReleased: 2013 | Developer: Ed Key and David Kanaga | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nProteus takes nature and simplifies it into evocative shapes and sounds. Curved hills, solid tree trunks, frogs that burble and bounce. Wandering over its island of pastel plants and animals triggers a variety of pleasant noises, a symphony that builds as you chase birds or stand still among the fireflies. It\\'s what every chillout room aspires to be.\\n\\nStrategy games\\n\\nInto The Breach\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Subset Games | GOG, Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nTry to save the human race from an alien invasion, five turns at a time, in the brilliant bite-sized roguelike strategy game from the makers of FTL. Into the Breach feels almost like a puzzle game, because it presents you with clear information on what the enemy is doing every turn, and it\\'s so well-balanced, there\\'s almost always a solution that will get you out of a mission alive. There are multiple teams of mechs to unlock and choose from, and their abilities play off one another incredibly well. In the Rusting Hulks squad, for example, the nimble Jet Mech can drop a bomb that deals damage and envelops enemies with a smoke cloud, while the passive ability on the Rocket Mech causes smoke clouds to deal damage to enemy units. Each squad has its own playstyle, and you can freely mix and match mechs to create your own team-ups. Ending a mission after preventing all damage to the fragile civilian buildings scattered around the map never stops feeling like a triumph.\\n\\nXCOM 2: War of the Chosen\\n\\nReleased: 2017 | Developer: Firaxis | XCOM 2 on Humble | War of the Chosen on Humble | Our review\\n\\nThis brutal strategy game puts you in charge of a resistance force during an alien occupation. The XCOM format blends base building, squad construction and strategic command with tense turn-based tactical battles. As you pilot your enormous home base between territories, you gather materials and research the enemy to unlock cooler space lasers and rad-as-hell armour for your crew.\\n\\nVanila XCOM 2 was a tough, lean survival game that held you to account with a doomsday countdown. War of the Chosen gives you even more problems in the form of three minibosses who stalk you throughout your campaign. Fortunately, you can befriend three resistance factions—each with their own suite of gadgets for you to research—and use their leads to track down your nemeses. The result is a layered, engrossing tactical game with a lot of dramatic intrigue. We developed a strong love/hate relationship with the Chosen. Hate to see them messing up our plans; love to blow them up with massive space guns in revenge.\\n\\nTotal War: Warhammer 2\\n\\nReleased: 2017| Developer: Creative Assembly | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nWarhammer is a dark fantasy setting shared by multiple games, popular because of its grim maximalism (it has two Mordors and about three Draculas). The Total War games are a venerable series of historical strategy games with unit-shuffling battles and large-scale nation management. The combination of Total War and Warhammer is a perfect match. Warhammer\\'s factions are strong mixes of trad fantasy archetypes and oddballs like the beloved ratmen called skaven, who are easily set against each other on a big map. Meanwhile, the abstract scale of Total War seems less odd when removed from recognizable historical events. It\\'s the best of both worlds. There\\'s a campaign where each faction races to control a magical vortex by conducting a string of rituals, each providing a significant boost when performed, but if you want to slow the pace you can spring for both this and the previous game, then combine their maps together into a gigantic life-consuming war for domination called Mortal Empires.\\n\\nSlay the Spire\\n\\nReleased: 2019 | Developer: Harebrained Schemes | Steam | Our review\\n\\nA brilliant singleplayer deck builder, Slay the Spire hooked the PC Gamer team back when it was in Early Access, and now it has even more to offer, including daily challenges and custom runs. The joy of it, as Evan explains in his review, is how much power you can accrue through smart deckbuilding. Because it\\'s a singleplayer card game, the monsters don\\'t have to have fun, and your deck doesn\\'t have to be balanced with any other—which means absurd combos are possible. But it\\'s also possible to create terrible decks as you ascend the spire, picking new cards along the way and finding relics that encourage certain builds. There\\'s so much strategy to learn that it can take tens of hours to reach the endgame, but starting a new run always feels exciting.\\n\\nBattleTech\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Harebrained Schemes | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nLead a scrappy mercenary company across a half-scripted, half-procedurally generated singleplayer campaign as you complete escort, assassination, base capture, and other missions for cash, salvage, and faction reputation. In the style of XCOM, BattleTech is about sending roster of mechs (and to a lesser extent pilots) into planetary combat, then managing the monetary and mortal aftermath of that spent armor, broken mech legs, dead pilots, and plundered parts of your enemies in the comfort of your spaceship base.\\n\\nUnlike XCOM, the turn-based combat is a wonderfully granular game of angles and details: mechs have 11 different armor segments, and weapons and ammo are housed in these individually destructible locations. The orientation, heat level, speed, and stability of your mechs matters, and fights between the durable walking tanks play out like heavyweight boxing matches.\\n\\nOn the next page: Puzzle games, great stories, simulations and city-builders...\\n\\nPuzzle games\\n\\nReturn of the Obra Dinn\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Valve | Steam, itch.io\\n\\nOur favorite puzzle game of 2018, Return of the Obra Dinn is a detective game set upon a ship once lost at sea. You, an insurance investigator, must determine what happened to the crew. We\\'re sure you\\'ve never played anything quite like it (unless you\\'ve played it).\\n\\nPortal 1 + 2\\n\\nReleased: 2007/2011 | Developer: Lucas Pope | Steam\\n\\nPortal would be great if it only had inventive puzzles. It would be great if it only had clever writing. Somehow Valve managed to pack both into an unmissable, unforgettable experience that messes with your head in more ways than one. Its titular mechanic teaches you to think differently by letting you instantaneously create paths to almost everywhere, and its underlying story, at once grim and gut-bustingly funny, is constantly egging you on.\\n\\nPortal 2, meanwhile, delivers more of everything that made Portal great, and a peerless co-op mode besides. Portal 2\\'s world is bigger and its puzzles are more complex, and it doesn\\'t sacrifice any of the series\\' sinister, sassy humor to pull them off. But the sequel\\'s true triumph is that it invites you to play with a friend—not through some tacked-on bonus levels, but through a handcrafted co-op campaign so good it makes the stellar singleplayer feel like a prelude.\\n\\nOpus Magnum\\n\\nReleased: 2017 | Developer: Zachtronics | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nThe challenge of Opus Magnum isn\\'t just to figure out how to solve each puzzle, but how to solve it the best way. With programmable robot arms you\\'ll build alchemy machines that are more or less efficient at the transmutation task put before you, and there\\'s an amazing number of ways to succeed—simple parts and simple instructions can produce some not-so-simple machines. If it grabs you, Opus Magnum doesn\\'t let you go easily.\\n\\nGorogoa\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Buried Signal | GOG, Steam | Our review\\n\\nThe gorgeous, hand-drawn Gorogoa is one of our favorite recent puzzle games. The premise is simple: arrange illustrated tiles \"in imaginative ways\" to solve puzzles. The complexity, and the feat of its creation, is in how those tiles interlock with impeccable elegance. As Pip said in our review: \"Chunks of interiors and exteriors match perfectly without seeming out of place in either of their respective scenes, an image in a thought bubble lines up with a balcony scene, a star in the sky is positioned perfectly so that it peeps through the gap in an overlaid tile and becomes the light from a lamp.\" It\\'s best to see it in motion, so check out the trailer here.\\n\\nLumines Remastered\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Resonair | Steam | Our review\\n\\nThe classic musical puzzle game, which was first released on the PSP, returns in top shape and is still great after 15 years. The new version is far superior to the original PC port, and the remastered music is fabulous. Lumines doesn\\'t translate perfectly to PC—it\\'s one of those games that feels like it was meant for handheld devices—but if you missed it the first time around, take any opportunity to play it.\\n\\nBaba is You\\n\\nReleased: 2019 | Developer: Hempuli Oy | Steam, itch.io | Our review\\n\\nA wonderful puzzle game in which you rearrange words to create new rules for the world. \"It’s part logic puzzle, part existential quandary, part love letter to how much potential is contained in the tiny building blocks of language,\" said Philippa in her Baba is You review.\\n\\nGreat stories\\n\\nWhat Remains of Edith Finch\\n\\nReleased: 2017 | Developer: Giant Sparrow | GOG, Steam | Our review\\n\\nExplore the curious home of a doomed family in this surprising and varied narrative game, which at first feels like a familiar walking simulator but then transforms into something else. Each member of the Finch family has a story to tell about what became of them, and each tale is presented in almost a minigame-like way—some of these chapters are thrilling, most of them are quietly devastating, and you should play this game without having a single one spoiled. You deserve to discover the secrets of this mysterious house for yourself if you haven\\'t already. More than deserving of our GOTY award for Best Story in 2017.\\n\\nLife is Strange\\n\\nReleased: 2015 | Developer: Dontnod | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nYou could argue most videogame stories are Young Adult fiction, but Life is Strange is actually like the kind of story in the YA section of your local bookstore. It\\'s about teenagers, small towns with secrets, and coming to terms with adult responsibilities through the metaphor of being able to rewind time. It\\'s Twin Peaks for teens.\\n\\nLife is Strange benefited from being released episodically, able to adapt to what players enjoyed about the early chapters and then focus on those elements later. That means you have to give it an episode and a half to get going, and the finale\\'s divisive too, but in the middle it\\'s as affecting an emotional rollercoaster as anything that\\'s about to be turned into a movie and make someone very rich.\\n\\nTacoma\\n\\nReleased: 2017 | Developer: Fullbright | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nCalling a game a \\'walking simulator\\' was probably meant to be pejorative, but I can\\'t think of a better description of what games like Tacoma and Gone Home—and developer Fullbright—do better than any other game: build a world I want to walk around in, explore, and learn to love. In Tacoma, the player walks into an abandoned space station and a mystery. Exploring this detailed setting feels like spending time in a real place, and hours spent there make the departed crew intimately familiar. I saw dozens of tiny stories, comedies and dramas, unfold as I watched the crew through VR recordings and dug into their discarded belongings. If you want to see the future of storytelling, to experience characters and plot in a way that can\\'t be duplicated in a book or a movie, go for walk in Tacoma.\\n\\nSimulations, sports games, and city builders\\n\\nForza Horizon 4\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Playground Games | Microsoft Store | Our review\\n\\nUnless you\\'re looking for a hardcore sim, Forza Horizon is still the best racing series around.\\n\\nEuro Truck Simulator 2\\n\\nReleased: 2013 | Developer: SCS Software | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nA lot of players have the same story about Euro Truck Simulator 2. Lured in by curiosity, we try this ridiculous-looking game about driving trucks back and forth across a low-budget Europe. Then, hours later, we\\'re flicking headlights up and down while driving through the night. It starts to rain somewhere outside Berlin, the sound adding percussion to whatever\\'s playing on the central European radio station. We\\'re hooked and don\\'t even know why. Even on a different continent in American Truck Simulator it can have the same effect, proving that ordinary inspirations modeled well enough can make for extraordinary games.\\n\\nElite Dangerous\\n\\nReleased: 2014 | Developer: Frontier Developments | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nSpace, to borrow a phrase, is big. Really, really big. In Elite: Dangerous, players can become deep-space explorers spanning the entire Milky Way galaxy, or they can be asteroid miners whose entire world consists of two space rocks and the vacuum between them. Both are equally worthy ways to use your flight time in Elite, an open-world (open-galaxy?) space flight sim that masterfully gives players total freedom. At the high end, you can spend your time being everything from a space trucker to a bounty hunter, but newbies shouldn\\'t overlook the simple joy of being a pilot, of the tactile way that flight skills grow and deepen over time. Anyone into sci-fi or flight sims owes it to themselves to spend time in an Elite cockpit—especially if they can do it in VR.\\n\\nFootball Manager 2019\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Sports Interactive | Steam | Our review\\n\\nThe best game yet in the best football management series.\\n\\nFrostpunk\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: 11 Bit Studios | GOG, Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nPart city-builder, part survival game, Frostpunk is about making difficult choices and dealing with the consequences. Trying to keep a handful of citizens alive in a perpetually frozen world isn\\'t just about managing resources but managing hope, and to keep people working toward their future means convincing them there is one, often through brutal means.\\n\\nUnlike most city-building games, Frostpunk isn\\'t an open-ended experience: it takes place over a 45 day period, with narrative events occurring periodically that can throw a wrench in the gears of your city and society. It\\'s a tense and grim experience where you can wind up regretting your finest moments or defending the harshest choices you made. What are you prepared to do to save lives, and what will the ultimate cost be?\\n\\nSuper Mega Baseball 2\\n\\nReleased: 2018 | Developer: Metalhead Software | Steam | Our review\\n\\nWith so few great sports games on PC, Super Mega Baseball 2 gets squished into our sims category for now—though with Madden finally coming back to PC this year, we may need to add a proper sports category. Super Mega Baseball 2 may look cartooney, but look beyond that, because as we said in our review, it\\'s the \"best on-field baseball sim on PC.\"\\n\\nOn the next page: MMOs, local multiplayer games, and platformers...\\n\\nMMOs and online RPGs\\n\\nWorld of Warcraft\\n\\nReleased: 2004 | Developer: Blizzard Entertainment | Official site | Our review\\n\\nWorld of Warcraft might have a few grey hairs here and there, but it\\'s still the undisputed king of MMOs. Set in the high-fantasy setting of the famous Warcraft real-time strategy games, World of Warcraft is the story of you, a hero who rises from lowly pawn to god-slaying badass as you strive to save your world from all manner of fiendish enemies. With 12 classes and 13 races to play as (and an ever-growing list of subraces), who and what your character will become is entirely up to you. And whether you want to play for two hours a month or two hours a night, there are a nearly unlimited number of places to explore, quests to complete, raids and dungeons to conquer, and items to craft. It\\'s less of a videogame and more of a part-time hobby.\\n\\nWorld of Warcraft\\'s latest expansion, Battle for Azeroth, is a bit of a low-point for the series according to its most hardcore fans. That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s bad—the austere mountains of Kul Tiras and lush jungles of Zandalar are evocative and fun to explore—but it is disappointing because World of Warcraft\\'s usually stellar endgame of dungeons and raids are hamstrung somewhat by its wonky gear system. There\\'s exciting news on that front, though: the next update is going to be huge.\\n\\nWorld of Warcraft is the jack-of-all-trades MMO that can satisfy nearly any kind of player. Whether you want competitive PvP battles, white-knuckle raids, or just a fun, colorful story to follow along with while you collect mounts, World of Warcraft delivers.\\n\\nWarframe\\n\\nReleased: 2013| Developer: Digital Extremes | Steam | Our review\\n\\nSet in a bizarre science-fiction universe full of esoteric secrets, Warframe sells itself on one amazing concept: You are a space ninja. And yes, it\\'s as fun as it sounds. This free-to-play third-person shooter gleefully taps into the fantasy of being a gun-toting, sword-wielding killing machine through its versatile movement system. You\\'ll air dash, wall run, and slide through levels with up to three teammates as you eviscerate hordes of android enemies in exchange for oodles of crafting resources.\\n\\nBut Warframe\\'s true strength is just how complex it is. Each Warframe (a kind of suit of armor that you wear) plays like its own character class, complete with unique abilities that define its combat style. You might charge into packs headfirst as Rhino or silently assassinate your targets as Ivara. Hell, there\\'s even a Warframe that lets you compose your own music using an in-game sequencer to inflict debuffs on enemies. Learning how to craft and equip these Warframes is a daunting task for new players, but those who endure will find a rich action RPG that can easily devour thousands of hours. What\\'s more, Digital Extremes is constantly taking Warframe in bold new directions, like adding open world zones to explore with friends. It might not be an MMO in the traditional sense, but Warframe is every bit as massive.\\n\\nPath of Exile\\n\\nReleased: 2013 | Developer: Grinding Gear Games | Steam | Our review\\n\\nA free-to-play spiritual successor to the beloved Diablo 2, Path of Exile is a dauntingly complex action RPG that will make even the most zealous theorycrafter weep tears of joy. Behind that familiar loop of dungeon diving and looting are several dozen features that each feel like the Marianas trench of progression systems—they\\'re that deep. Skill gems can be chained together to create practically limitless spell combos, while the passive skill tree has hundreds of nodes to choose from that each shape your character in their own small way. And then, of course, comes the gear, which is a whole separate school of learning that can take months to fully understand. Path of Exile is certainly daunting and it won\\'t appeal to everyone.\\n\\nIt\\'s good news then that it\\'s also fun as hell. There\\'s 10 acts to explore, each one touring you through desecrated temples or corrupted jungles full of the walking dead. It\\'s a grim place to be, but the kinetic combat and enticing rewards make the journey worth it. Every few months, Grinding Gear Games rolls out a new temporary challenge league that introduces entirely new progression systems, cosmetics, and enemies but requires starting a new character. Normally that\\'d sound like a chore, but Path of Exile is so robust that starting fresh is just a chance to learn something new.\\n\\nEVE Online\\n\\nReleased: 2003 | Developer: CCP Games | Official site | Our review\\n\\nBrutal, uncompromising, and intimidating—there\\'s a good chance that EVE Online\\'s reputation precedes it. While its players will say that it\\'s mostly hyperbole, there\\'s no denying that EVE Online isn\\'t an MMO for the faint of heart. But in return for a considerable investment of your time and energy, EVE Online achieves something remarkable: It feels alive.\\n\\nThe galaxy of New Eden is an ever-evolving virtual world full of merchants and pirates, mercenaries and warlords, and, yeah, the occasional spy. It\\'s a thriving ecosystem grounded by a player-driven economy where players are encouraged to group together to achieve long term objectives like conquering territory or just becoming filthy, stinking rich. To participate, you\\'ll need to contend with a hopelessly unintuitive user interface and familiarize yourself with a daunting number of systems. But it\\'s worth it. The focus on player-driven experiences creates stories that just don\\'t happen in any other kind of game, and being apart of those narratives is thrilling. It\\'s an experience that is so absorbing, there\\'s a good reason why EVE players joke that quitting for good is \"winning at EVE Online.\"\\n\\nFinal Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn\\n\\nReleased: 2014 | Developer: Square Enix | Steam | Our review\\n\\nFinal Fantasy 14 is a dream come true for Final Fantasy fans who don\\'t mind the rigamarole that comes standard with MMOs. Set in the high fantasy world of Eorzea, you play as one of the series\\' iconic classes, like a black mage, and set out to help the locals defend themselves from constant invasions by the evil Garlean Empire. It\\'s as generic a Final Fantasy story as they come, but FF14 lives up to the series legacy by populating the world with an endearing ensemble of characters that grow significantly over the course of its two expansions. If you like story-driven MMOs, Final Fantasy 14\\'s sweeping epic is undoubtedly the best.\\n\\nSquare Enix doesn\\'t try to reinvent the wheel when it comes to being an MMO, though. Final Fantasy 14 is formulaic in its progression and the equipment system is pretty bland. It is by no means boring, however. The story reaches some surprising highs and Final Fantasy fans will be pleased to hear that FF14 has a nearly endless supply of memorable boss fights to work through. It might not be as expansive as other MMOs, but Final Fantasy 14 is beautiful and charming.\\n\\nLocal multiplayer games\\n\\nNidhogg 2\\n\\nReleased: 2017 | Developer: Messhof | Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nSome say Nidhogg 2\\'s clay-monstrosity art style and added weapons marred the elegance of the first game, but they\\'re both great in their own ways. Whichever one you choose, the basic format is the same: two players duel across a single screen, attempting to push their opponent left or right into the next screen, all the way to the end of the map. That\\'s a big part of the brilliance of the series: get pushed all the way to your corner, and it\\'s still possible to make a comeback and finesse your opponent all the way back across the map for a clutch win. Pure thrill.\\n\\nThe fighting itself is great, too, like an ultra-lo-fi Bushido Blade. Kills come in one hit as you thrust and parry and throw your swords with simple controls that result in complex dances of stance and aggression. It\\'s exciting, hilarious, and tests the hell out of your reaction time and ability to predict your opponent\\'s moves. There\\'s nothing quite like either Nidhogg.\\n\\nTowerFall Ascension\\n\\nReleased: 2014 | Developer: Matt Thorson | GOG, Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nAs cool as bows and arrows are in games like Tomb Raider, TowerFall does them best. Whether played by four people against each other, or two in co-op against waves of monsters, TowerFall makes leaping from a ledge and skewering somebody with a perfect shot easy to do. It also makes shooting at someone above you, missing, and then impaling yourself as the arrow falls back down easy to do. It\\'s as chaotic as it sounds, but the clean pixel art and expressive animation makes it simple to follow, and every triumph and screw-up is visible to all.\\n\\nOvercooked 1 and Overcooked 2\\n\\nReleased: 2018| Developer: Ghost Town Games | Steam | Our review\\n\\nWe hate Overcooked. Wait, no: We hate anyone who gets in the way in Overcooked, or doesn\\'t bring us our damn tomatoes when we need them, pre-chopped. This four-player kitchen catastrophe simulator sets up some brilliantly simple basics—working together to prepare ingredients, cook basic dishes, and turn them in on a tight timetable—and then mercilessly complicates them with devious kitchen hazards. In one level, on the deck of a pirate ship, some of your counters slide back and forth, forcing you to switch up tasks on the fly. In another cramped kitchen, there isn\\'t enough space for two characters to squeeze past one another, forcing you to coordinate all your movements or get into shouting matches about which direction to go.\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of shouting in Overcooked, but barking orders, properly divvying up jobs, and setting a new high score feels so good. The controls are intuitive enough that infrequent gamers can get onboard. Just beware of playing with anyone with a truly explosive temper. While both are great, if you haven\\'t played either we\\'d recommend Overcooked 2, which adds online play.\\n\\n2D platformers\\n\\nSpelunky\\n\\nReleased: 2013 | Developer: Mossmouth | GOG, Steam | Our review\\n\\nSpelunky deserves much of the credit (or blame) for the boom of roguelikes in the 2010s, but none have bettered the rich interactions of this game, which sees you adventuring through mines, the jungle, caverns, and even Hell in search of riches and escape. You\\'ll die many, many times along the way—sometimes suddenly, sometimes hilariously, and often because of your own stupidity. But that arms you with knowledge of what not to do and how to exploit the game. Can you trick two NPCs into fighting each other? Can you use a damsel you should be rescuing to instead safely set off a trap for you? What\\'s the deal with the Ankh, anyway?\\n\\nThese are all things you\\'ll discover as you play more Spelunky. Half the game is 2D platformer; the other half is a rich simulation packed with secrets and interlocking pieces that make the entire game feel like a living organism designed with the express purpose of killing you. That\\'s what makes pulling those pieces apart and using them to your advantage so endlessly satisfying.\\n\\nCeleste\\n\\nReleased: 2018| Developer: Matt Makes Games | Steam | Our review\\n\\nIn this age of quick saves and infinite lives, action-oriented platformers need to be difficult. And this difficulty almost always becomes the talking point, even for games that seem to hide something more profound beneath their mounds of countless dead (see: The End is Nigh). But no one talks about how hard Celeste is—or at least, that’s not why we talk about it. Even if you roll your eyes at the masochistic appeal of Super Meat Boy or N++, you might find yourself seeing Celeste through to the end. Sharing the vibrant, chunky pixel-art of Matt Makes Games Inc’s TowerFall, Celeste charts its protagonist Madeline’s efforts to scale a gigantic mountain. She’s not going up there to save the world, she’s going up there to save herself. It’s hardly a visual novel, but the light narrative dabs make progress more meaningful than “simply wanting to do it”, and its set-piece moments are really spectacular. It feels great too: Madeline can grab onto walls and quick-dash through the air, and there’s never a lack of new environmental challenges to ward off monotony.\\n\\nHollow Knight\\n\\nReleased: 2017| Developer: Team Cherry| Humble Store, Steam | Our review\\n\\nHollow Knight is still slightly too new to be regarded as highly as Nintendo\\'s genre-defining Super Metroid, but it might actually be the better game (gasp!). It\\'s at least the best game to follow in Metroid\\'s footsteps in a decade (if you want more games in this vein, make sure to play Cave Story). You play as a small explorer venturing through the remnants of Hallownest, an underground bug civilization, with remarkably little hand-holding showing you where to go. Subtle environmental clues and smartly doled-out powerups will help you find your path through the world, and from the first moments the 2D essentials of jumping and attacking have a perfectly tuned weight and snappiness to them. That\\'s what will keep you playing Hollow Knight long enough to be pulled into its world, and then there\\'s no turning back.\\n\\nSome online stores give us a small cut if you buy something through one of our links.

              "[\"JULY MARKS the 55th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, which outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, colour, religion, sex, or national origin. It also enforced desegregation of the government-run school system nationwide, largely ending the practice of educational apartheid. But while desegregation transformed America's education system, the way it was implemented by discriminatory school boards in the South was harmful to black teachers. A new paper by Owen Thompson, an economist at Williams College, shows there was a dramatic decline in the employment of African-American teachers in the aftermath of desegregation. The policies behind that decline have contributed to lower employment for African-American educators in the decades since.\\n\\nIn 1954 the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Brown v Board of Education that “in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place.” Ten years later, less than 5% of black children in the Southern states of the former Confederacy were attending school with whites. The Civil Rights Act, which among other enforcement mechanisms tied federal education funding to school integration, dramatically changed that: by 1970, more than 90% of black children attended schools that also taught white children.\\n\\nFor African-American students, the impact of desegregation was overwhelmingly positive. It was one reason why the gap between test scores of black and white students born in 1954 and those born 30 years later declined by nearly 40%, according to research by Eric Hanushek and colleagues at Stanford University.\\n\\nFor African-American teachers, it was a different story. Before the Civil Rights Act, Southern black schools were staffed almost exclusively by black teachers. Nearly half of African-Americans with a post-secondary education living in the South listed teaching as their occupation. As schools were consolidated, black students were bused to white schools, white teachers were put in charge of integrated classrooms, and black teachers were demoted to substitute status or fired—often on the basis of newly-instituted testing and accreditation requirements. Court cases over discriminatory firing were repeatedly thrown out and it took until 1971 for the federal government to mandate non-discriminatory employment practices in public education. By that point, the consolidation process, with its associated sackings, was largely complete.\\n\\nMr Thompson examined the impact of desegregation-related firings and separations using a database covering 781 Southern school districts. Most commonly, the transition in these districts between 1964 and 1972 was from complete segregation to complete integration. Over those six years, black-teacher employment dropped 32%. Mr Thompson estimates that more than 15,800 black teachers left schools in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia alone. Earlier estimates suggest 38,000 African-American educators lost their jobs across the South and the border states. The displaced teachers moved to other professions or moved out of the South entirely.\\n\\nIt seems likely that for black students, the impact of desegregation will have been blunted by this displacement of black teachers. Mr Thompson cites studies suggesting that being assigned to an own-race teacher improves test scores in maths and reading tests by about five percentage points, as well as reducing suspensions and expulsions.\\n\\nThe share of black teachers in government schools nationwide has continued to decline: from 8.1% in 1971 to 6.9% in 1986 and 6.7% today—this during a period during which the black share of the population as a whole has risen to nearly 13%. There are a number of reasons for the decline, including an increased range of professional opportunities for African-Americans in other fields. But it is also true that desegregation accelerated a trend towards ever-greater teacher accreditation requirements that continued to disproportionately affect African-Americans. When North Carolina raised its cut-off scores for the National Teacher Exam in the late 1970s, for example, it was associated with a 73% drop in newly licenced black teachers in the state between 1975 and 1982.\\n\\nWhile higher teacher accreditation standards reduce the number of black teachers, they have done little for students of any ethnicity: teacher licencing test scores are weakly related to outcomes for students. That helps to explain why Mr Hanushek found no significant gains in average test scores for American 17-year-olds tested between 1987 and 2017, and no further progress in closing the black-white test gap since the 1980s. The legacy of a discriminatory response to desegregation continues a half-century on, with limited benefit to children.\"]"
